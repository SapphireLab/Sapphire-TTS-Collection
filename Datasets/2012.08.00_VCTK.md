This CSTR VCTK Corpus includes speech data uttered by 110 English speakers with various accents.
Each speaker reads out about 400 sentences, which were selected from a newspaper, the rainbow passage and an elicitation paragraph used for the speech accent archive.
The newspaper texts were taken from Herald Glasgow, with permission from Herald & Times Group.
Each speaker has a different set of the newspaper texts selected based a greedy algorithm that increases the contextual and phonetic coverage.
The details of the text selection algorithms are described in the following paper: C. Veaux, J. Yamagishi and S. King, "The voice bank corpus: Design, collection and data analysis of a large regional accent speech database," https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSDA.2013.6709856
The rainbow passage and elicitation paragraph are the same for all speakers.
The rainbow passage can be found at International Dialects of English Archive: (http://web.ku.edu/~idea/readings/rainbow.htm).
The elicitation paragraph is identical to the one used for the speech accent archive (http://accent.gmu.edu).
The details of the the speech accent archive can be found at http://www.ualberta.ca/~aacl2009/PDFs/WeinbergerKunath2009AACL.pdf
All speech data was recorded using an identical recording setup: an omni-directional microphone (DPA 4035) and a small diaphragm condenser microphone with very wide bandwidth (Sennheiser MKH 800), 96kHz sampling frequency at 24 bits and in a hemi-anechoic chamber of the University of Edinburgh.
(However, two speakers, p280 and p315 had technical issues of the audio recordings using MKH 800).
All recordings were converted into 16 bits, were downsampled to 48 kHz, and were manually end-pointed.
This corpus was originally aimed for HMM-based text-to-speech synthesis systems, especially for speaker-adaptive HMM-based speech synthesis that uses average voice models trained on multiple speakers and speaker adaptation technologies.
This corpus is also suitable for DNN-based multi-speaker text-to-speech syn

CSTR VCTK 语料库包含 110 位带有各种口音的英语说话人的语音数据.
每位说话人朗读了大约 400 句话, 这些句子选自报纸, 彩虹段落, 用于语音口音归档的诱发段落.
报纸文本来自 Herald Glasgow, 获得了 Herald & Times Group 的许可.
每位说话人朗读的报纸文本是基于贪婪算法选择的以增加内容和语音覆盖.
文本选择算法的详细信息可在《The Voice Bank Corpus: Design, Collection and Data Analysis of A Large Regional Accent Speech Database》中找到.
彩虹段落和诱发段落对所有说话人都一样.
彩虹段落可以在 International Dialects of English Archive 找到;
诱发段落和用于语音口音档案的段落相同.
语音口音档案可以在 [Slide](http://www.ualberta.ca/~aacl2009/PDFs/WeinbergerKunath2009AACL.pdf) 了解细节.
所有语音数据都使用相同的录音设置录制的: 全向麦克风, 大带宽的小振膜电容麦克风, 采样频率位 96kHz, 24 位, 爱丁堡大学的半消音室内.
(然而, 两个说话人, p280 和 p315, 使用 MKH 800 录制音频时出现技术问题).

所有的录音都被转化为 16 位, 下采样到 48kHz, 手动进行了端点检测.
该语料库最初旨在用于基于 HMM 的文本转语音合成系统, 特别是使用多个说话人训练的平均语音模型和说话人自适应技术.
这一语料库也适用于基于 DNN 的多说话人文本转语音合成系统和神经波形建模.

该数据集在 Google DeepMind 的 WaveNet 工作中被引用: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03499.pdf.

注意: 虽然 110 个录音中的 109 个提供了包含语音转录的文本文件, 位于 `/txt` 文件夹中, 但 `p315` 文本由于硬盘错误而丢失.
