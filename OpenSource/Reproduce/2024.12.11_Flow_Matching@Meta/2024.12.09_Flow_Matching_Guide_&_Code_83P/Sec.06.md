# 6Â·Continuous Time Markov Chain Models

This section presents the \highlight{Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMCs)} as an alternative generative model to flow, with the use-case of generating discrete data, \ie, data residing in a discrete (and finite) state space.
CTMC are Markov processes that form the building blocks behind the generative model paradigm of Discrete Flow Matching (DFM) \cite{campbell2024generative,gat2024discrete}, later discussed in~\cref{sec:discreteflow}.
Therefore, this section is analogous to \cref{s:flow_models}, where we presented flows as the building blocks behind the generative model paradigm of Flow Matching (FM).
