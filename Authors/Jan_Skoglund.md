# Jan Skoglund

> Jan Skoglund received the Ph.D. degree from the Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, in 1998. He leads a team with Google, San Francisco, CA, USA, developing speech and audio signal processing components for capture, real-time communication, storage, and rendering. These components were deployed in Google software products, such as meet and hardware products such as Chromebooks. After receiving his Ph.D. degree, he worked on low bit rate speech coding with AT&T Labs-Research, Florham Park, NJ, USA. From 2000 to 2011, he was with Global IP Solutions (GIPS), San Francisco, CA, USA, working on speech and audio processing, such as compression, enhancement, and echo cancellation, tailored for packet-switched networks. GIPS’ audio and video technology was found in many deployments by, such as, IBM, Google, Yahoo, WebEx, Skype, and Samsung, and was open-sourced as WebRTC after a 2011 acquisition by Google. Since then, he has been a part of Chrome with Google.
