## Abstract: 摘要

<table><tr><td width="50%">

The rapid advancement of speech generation technologies in the era of large language models (LLMs) has established discrete speech tokens as a foundational paradigm for speech representation.
These tokens, characterized by their discrete, compact, and concise nature, are not only advantageous for efficient transmission and storage, but also inherently compatible with the language modeling framework, enabling seamless integration of speech into text-dominated LLM architectures.
Current research categorizes discrete speech tokens into two principal classes: acoustic tokens and semantic tokens, each of which has evolved into a rich research domain characterized by unique design philosophies and methodological approaches.
This survey systematically synthesizes the existing taxonomy and recent innovations in discrete speech tokenization, conducts a critical examination of the strengths and limitations of each paradigm, and presents systematic experimental comparisons across token types.
Furthermore, we identify persistent challenges in the field and propose potential research directions, aiming to offer actionable insights to inspire future advancements in the development and application of discrete speech tokens.

## 1·Introduction: 引言

<table><tr><td width="50%">

The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing has revolutionized speech generation tasks[^cui2024recent], [^ji2024wavchat], with speech being tokenized and modeled using decoder-only Transformers[^transformer].
Efforts starting from GSLM[^lakhotia2021generative] and AudioLM[^borsos2023audiolm] aim to develop text-free spoken LLMs, akin to how current LLM-powered chatbots enable text-based interactions.
Other works, including VALL-E[^valle] and VioLA[^wang2024viola], extend this approach to conditional speech generation tasks, such as zero-shot text-to-speech and speech translation.
However, this paradigm requires data to be tokenized, as LLMs typically process discrete data only.
Textual tokens naturally meet this requirement because they are designed as discrete units separated by clear boundaries, whereas raw speech signals are continuous and boundary-less.
Therefore, a necessary step before applying speech data to LLM is the \textbf{tokenization of speech}, whose goal is:

*To convert long speech waveforms into short discrete tokens for downstream tasks. These tokens should be compatible with the underlying textual representations, especially for language modeling approaches targeted at speech.*

As a result, significant efforts have been directed towards developing efficient and powerful speech tokenization methods. Generally, these methods are based on two distinct principles, giving rise to two types of speech tokens: acoustic tokens and semantic tokens.
Acoustic tokens are derived from neural codecs designed to encode speech at a low bitrate while preserving as much information as possible. In contrast, semantic tokens originate from speech self-supervised learning (SSL)[^mohamed2022self], which aims to learn a more phonetic or semantic representation space, making it easier for speech recognition.
These two nearly independent lines of research magically intersect in the context of language modeling for speech.
Now, there are also efforts that try to design a speech tokenizer that accomplishes the two objectives simultaneously[^zhang2024speechtokenizer], [^kyutai2024moshi].

Consequently, speech tokenization has become a core problem of speech processing under the new paradigm, with versatile downstream applications, as shown in Figure.01.

Despite the rapid development and numerous recent works, a comprehensive taxonomy of methodologies in discrete speech tokens has not been clearly constructed.
Existing reviews[^mohamed2022self], [^anees2024speech], [^wu2024towards], [^cui2024recent], [^kim2024neural], [^ji2024wavchat] in this field overlook the diverse categories and methodologies in both acoustic and semantic tokens.
- For example, [^cui2024recent], [^ji2024wavchat] focus primarily on methods in spoken language modeling, providing only brief descriptions of some speech tokens used in existing models.
- The taxonomy of neural audio codecs has been summarized in [^wu2024towards], [^du2025codecfake], but the realm of semantic tokens is still overlooked.

In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the concepts, methods, and characteristics of various types of discrete speech tokens, with their applications in spoken language understanding, speech generation, and spoken dialogue models.
We hope that through this review, the community can have a clear understanding of the current development and key technologies of discrete speech tokens, so as to promote further research in the future.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:
- This review is the first to focus specifically on discrete speech tokens with sufficient depth in the LLM era.
- We construct a comprehensive taxonomy of current research on discrete speech tokens and meticulously review the motivation, representative approaches, and challenges in each sub-category.
- We provide a unified comparison of different types of discrete speech tokens in terms of reconstruction and voice conversion performance, covering both acoustic and semantic tokens.
- We summarize the current challenges and potential future directions for discrete speech tokens, including decoupled and variable frame rate tokens.

The structure of this review is shown in Figure.02.

Following [^borsos2023audiolm], [^kharitonov2023speak], [^yang2024towards], we classify discrete speech tokens into acoustic and semantic tokens based on their principles.

## 2·Pre-Requisites: Discrete Representation Learning

<table><tr><td width="50%">

Discrete speech tokens are obtained through the quantization of continuous representations, which is usually achieved by offline clustering or online vector quantization algorithms.
This section provides a concise overview of the existing quantization methods commonly used in discrete speech tokens.

Denote $\bm x\in \mathbb R^d$ as a vector in the $d$-dimensional continuous space. A quantization process $q$ transforms $\bm x$ into a discrete \textit{token} in a finite set, i.e. $q(\bm x): \mathbb R^d\to\{1,2,...,V\}$ where $V$ is the \textit{vocabulary size}.
The output tokens are sometimes referred to as \textit{indexes} in the finite $V$-cardinal set.
The function $q$ is usually associated with a \textit{codebook} $\mathcal C=\{\bm c_1,\bm c_2,...,\bm c_V\}$ where every \textit{code-vector} $\bm c_i\in\mathbb R^d$ corresponds to the $i$-th token.
The code-vectors are representations of tokens in the original $d$-dimensional space.
As $V$ elements can be encoded using $\lceil \log_2 V\rceil$ raw bits\footnote{We use $\lceil z\rceil$ to denote the ceiling of a scalar $z$, i.e., the smallest integer greater than or equal to $z$.
Similarly, $\lfloor z\rfloor$ denotes the floor of $z$, i.e., the largest integer less than or equal to $z$.}, quantization often compresses the cost for data storage and transmission to a great extent.

### Offline Clustering

<table><tr><td width="50%">

Clustering is a simple approach for quantization.
Given a dataset $X=\{\bm x_1,\bm x_2,...\bm x_N\}$, a clustering algorithm aims to assign each sample $\bm x_i$ to a group such that some cost is minimized.
The most frequently used clustering method for discrete speech tokens is k-means clustering[^IKOTUN2023178], e.g. in GSLM[^lakhotia2021generative].
K-means is a clustering algorithm based on Euclidean distances.
Its training process iteratively assigns each data sample to the nearest centroid, and moves cluster centroids till convergence, with a pre-defined number of clusters.
After training, the centroids form the codebook, and new data can be quantized to the index of the nearest centroid in this Voronoi partition.
In practice, centroids are usually initialized with the k-means++ algorithm[^kmeans++] for better convergence.

Hierarchical agglomerative clustering has also been used in discrete speech tokens, which iteratively merges the closest clusters.
It is usually applied after k-means to reduce the number of clusters[^cho2024sd], [^baade2024syllablelm].
Other clustering algorithms are less explored in the context of discrete speech tokens.

### Vector Quantization

<table><tr><td width="50%">

Clustering is often an isolate process, thus cannot be optimized together with other neural network modules.
Instead, vector quantization (VQ)[^gray1984vector] enables a learnable network module that allows gradients to pass through when producing discrete representations.
Autoencoders with a VQ module is termed VQ-VAE[^VQVAE].
There are multiple VQ methods:

</td><td>

<tr><td>

#### K-Means VQ

Like k-means clustering, k-means VQ method finds the code-vector closest to the input, i.e.

$$
    q(\bm x)=\underset{i\in \{1,2,...,V\}}{\arg\min} \|\bm x-\bm c_i\|^2.
$$

Then, code-vector $\bm c_k\triangleq\bm c_{q(\mathbf x)}$ is fed to subsequent networks.
As the $\min$ operation is not differentiable, straight-through estimators (STEs)[^bengio2013estimating] are usually applied to graft gradients, i.e. $\operatorname{STE}(\bm c_k,\bm x)=\bm x+\operatorname{sg}(\bm c_k-\bm x)$ where $\operatorname{sg(\cdot)}$ stops tracking gradients.
In this way, the input value to subsequent networks is still $\bm c_k$, but gradients are grafted to $\bm x$ in back propagation.

Auxiliary loss functions are often used together with k-means VQ[^VQVAE]: commitment loss $\mathcal L_{\text{cmt}}=\|\operatorname{sg}(\bm c_k)-\bm x\|^2$ and codebook loss $\mathcal L_{\text{code}}=\|\operatorname{sg}(\bm x)-\bm c_k\|^2$.
The commitment loss pushes the continuous input $\bm x$ towards the closest codebook entry, while the codebook loss does the opposite and updates the code-vector $\bm c_k$.
The two loss terms are weighted by different factors to put different optimization strengths on $\bm x$ and $\bm c_k$, as pushing $\bm c_k$ towards $\bm x$ is an easier task.
It is also common to replace $\mathcal L_{\text{code}}$ with exponential moving average (EMA) to update the codebook instead[^razavi2019generating], which does not rely on explicit loss functions.

VQ in high-dimensional spaces is known to suffer from codebook collapse,  where the codebook usage is highly imbalanced[^lancucki2020robust], [^dhariwal2020jukebox].
To improve the utilization of codebook, random replacement (as known as \textit{codebook expiration}) can be applied[^dhariwal2020jukebox] on code-vectors that have remained inactive for a long time.
Other solutions include additional auxiliary constraints such as entropy penalty[^chang2022maskgit], [^yu2024language], factorized codebook lookup in low-dimensional space[^yu2022vectorquantized], and adding a linear projection to update all code-vectors together[^zhu2024addressing].

#### Gumbel VQ

Instead of quantizing by Euclidean distance, another choice is by probability.
Gumbel VQ[^jang2017categorical] uses Gumbel-Softmax as a proxy distribution for traditional Softmax to allow differentiable sampling.
Given input $\bm x$ and a codebook of size $V$, a transform $h(\cdot)$ is applied on $\bm x$ into $V$ logits: $\bm l=h(\bm x)\in \mathbb R^V$.
In inference, quantization is performed by choosing the index with the largest logit, i.e. $q(\bm x)=\arg\max_i \left\{\bm l^{(i)}\right\}$.
In training, samples are drawn from the categorical distribution implied by $\bm l$ for the subsequent neural networks.
To achieve efficient sampling and let gradients pass through, Gumbel trick is used:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    &\bm u\in \mathbb R^V\sim \operatorname{Uniform}(0, 1),\bm v=-\log(-\log(\bm u)) \\
    &\bm s=\operatorname{Softmax}((\bm l+\bm v)/\tau)
\end{aligned}
$$

where Eq.\eqref{eq:gumbel-noise} samples Gumbel noise $\bm v$ element-wise, and Eq.\eqref{eq:gumbel-softmax} calculates Gumbel-Softmax distribution $\bm s$ with a temperature $\tau$.
The forward pass simply use $j=\arg\max_i \{\bm s^{(i)}\}$ as the sampled index, but the true gradient of Gumbel-Softmax is used in backward pass.
In other words, the gradient on the one-hot distribution corresponding to $j$ is grafted to $\bm s$ as an approximate.
The temperature $\tau$ balances the approximation accuracy and gradient variances.
The transform $h(\cdot)$ is usually parameterized as neural networks, or negatively proportional to Euclidean distances[^jiang2023latent].

After quantization, code-vector $\bm c_k$ with $k=q(\bm x)$ is fed to subsequent networks.
Gumbel VQ does not require additional losses, since code-vectors can be directly learned with gradients and do not need to be pushed towards $\bm x$.

#### Finite Scalar Quantization

As mentioned before, VQ methods based on code-vector assignment usually suffer from codebook collapse.
Despite many efforts, this remains a crucial challenge.
Finite scalar quantization (FSQ)[^mentzer2024finite] is an alternative to perform quantization in scalar domain.
FSQ quantizes each dimension of a vector $\bm x$ into $L$ levels.

For the $i$-th dimension $\bm x^{(i)}$, FSQ transforms the values to into limited range and then rounds to integers, i.e.

$$
    q\left(\bm x^{(i)}\right)=\operatorname{round}\left(\lfloor L/2\rfloor\tanh\left(\bm x^{(i)}\right)\right).
$$

The quantized values are thus integers ranging from $-\lfloor L/2 \rfloor$ to $\lfloor L/2 \rfloor$\footnote{Following [^mentzer2024finite], this is the symmetric case for $L$ being odd. When $L$ is even, there is an offset before rounding to obtain asymmetric quantized values.}.
For a $d$-dimensional vector $\bm x$, there are $L^d$ possible quantization outcomes.
Hence, FSQ usually requires a much smaller hidden dimension than VQ.
STE is applied to pass gradients.
As quantization is simply done via rounding to integers, there is no explicit codebooks associated with the FSQ process.
FSQ is reported to have  better codebook usage\footnote{Although there is no longer a codebook associated with code-vectors, codebook usage can still be measured among all possible $V=L^d$ outcomes.} especially for a large $V$ compared to VQ methods, without the need for auxiliary losses.

#### Other VQ Tricks

In many cases, a single VQ module suffers from a highly-limited representation space, thus results in poor performance compared to continuous counterparts.
There are some widely-used VQ tricks that introduce multiple quantizers to refine the quantized space, as shown in Figure.03:

- **Grouped VQ (GVQ)**, also known as **product quantization**[^product_quantization]. It groups the input vector $\bm x$ by dimensions and apply VQ on different parts of $\bm x$ independently. They can have different or shared codebooks. The VQ outputs are then concatenated along dimensions to match that of $\bm x$. For instance, GVQ is used in neural word embeddings[^9164982] and speech self-supervised learning models[^vq-wav2vec], [^baevski2020wav2vec] to achieve efficient quantization.
- **Residual VQ (RVQ)**, also known as **multi-stage quantization**[^multiple-stage-vector-quantization]. It adopts a serial approach that iteratively quantizes the residual of the last quantizer.
Similar to GVQ, RVQ also has multiple quantizers.
For the $i$-th quantizer $q_i$ with input $\bm x_i$ and output code-vector $\bm c_{k}$, the residual is defined as $\bm x_{i+1}=\bm x_i-\bm c_{k}$.
The outputs from all $q_i$ are finally summed as the quantized result of $\bm x$.
In this way, information in the codebooks is supposed to follow a coarse-to-fine order, and more details in the original $\bm x$ can be preserved than a plain quantizer.
It is used in various speech codecs[^zeghidour2021soundstream], [^encodec], [^kumar2024high], for instance.

GVQ and RVQ can be flexibly combined to form GRVQ[^yang2023hifi] that applies RVQ on each GVQ branch for better codebook utilization.
A network can also contain multiple VQ modules at different places, like cross-scale VQ (CSVQ)[^jiang22_interspeech] where every decoder layer has a quantizer inside.

Note that RVQ naturally produces an order of importance in residual layers, while all quantizers in GVQ are equally important.
Such order of importance can also be enforced in GVQ by a "nested dropout" trick[^rippel2014learning].
