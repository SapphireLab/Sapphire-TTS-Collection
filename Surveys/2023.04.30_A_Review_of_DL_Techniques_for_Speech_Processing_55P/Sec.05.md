# 5Â·Speech Processing Tasks

In recent times, the field of speech processing has gained significant attention due to its rapid evolution and its crucial role in modern technological applications.
This field involves the use of diverse techniques and algorithms to analyse and understand spoken language, ranging from basic speech recognition to more complex tasks such as spoken language understanding and speaker identification.
Since speech is one of the most natural forms of communication, speech processing has become a critical component of many applications such as virtual assistants, call centres, and speech-to-text transcription.
In this section, we provide a comprehensive overview of the various speech-processing tasks and the techniques used to achieve them, while also discussing the current challenges and limitations faced in this field and its potential for future development.

The assessment of speech-processing models depends greatly on the calibre of datasets employed.
By utilizing standardized datasets, researchers are enabled to objectively gauge the efficacy of varying approaches and identify scopes for advancement.
The selection of evaluation metrics plays a critical role in this process, hinging on the task at hand and the desired outcome.
Therefore, it is essential that researchers conduct a meticulous appraisal of different metrics to make informed decisions.
This paper offers a thorough summary of frequently utilized datasets and metrics across diverse downstream tasks, as presented in \Cref{dataset} and, \Cref{objective}.
