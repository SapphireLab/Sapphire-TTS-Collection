# 3路Deep Learning Architectures and Their Applications in Speech Processing Tasks

Deep learning architectures have revolutionized the field of speech processing by demonstrating remarkable performance across various tasks.
With their ability to automatically learn hierarchical representations from raw speech data, deep learning models have surpassed traditional approaches in areas such as speech recognition, speaker identification, and speech synthesis.
These architectures have been instrumental in capturing intricate patterns, uncovering latent features, and extracting valuable information from vast amounts of speech data.
In this section, we delve into the applications of deep learning architectures in speech processing tasks, exploring their potential, advancements, and the impact they have had on the field.
By examining the key components and techniques employed in these architectures, we aim to provide insights into the current state-of-the-art in deep learning for speech processing and shed light on the exciting prospects it holds for future advancements in the field.

## 3.1路Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

It is natural to consider Recurrent Neural Networks for various speech processing tasks since the input speech signal is inherently a dynamic process \cite{salehinejad2017recent}.
RNNs can model a given time-varying (sequential) patterns that were otherwise hard to capture by standard feedforward neural architectures.
Initially, RNNs were used in conjunction with HMMs where the sequential data is first modeled by HMMs while localized classification is done by the neural network.
However, such a hybrid model tends to inherit limitations of HMMs, for instance, HMM requires task-specific knowledge and independence constraints for observed states \cite{bourlard1994connectionist}.
To overcome the limitations inherited by the hybrid approach, end-to-end systems completely based on RNNs became popular for sequence transduction tasks such as speech recognition and text\cite{graves2012sequence, kawakami2008supervised}.
Next, we discuss RNN and it's variants:

### 3.1.1路RNN Models

#### Vanilla RNN

{Give input sequence of T states $(x_{1}, \ldots ,x_{T})$ with $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$, the output state at time $t$ can be computed as}

$$
    h_{t} = \mathcal{H}(W_{hh}h_{t-1}+W_{xh}x_{t}+b_h)
$$

$$
    y_{t} = W_{hy}h_{t}+b_y
$$

where $W_{hh}, W_{hx}, W_{yh}$ are weight matrices and $b_h, b_y$ are bias vectors.
$\mathcal{H}$ is non-linear activation functions such as Tanh, ReLU, and Sigmoid.
RNNs are made of high dimensional hidden states, notice $h_t$ in the above equation, which makes it possible for them to model sequences and help overcome the limitation of feedforward neural networks.
The state of the hidden layer is conditioned on the current input and the previous state, which makes the underlying operation recursive.
Essentially, the hidden state $h_{t-1}$ works as a memory of past inputs $\{x_k\}_{k=1}^{t-1}$ that influence the current output $y_t$.

#### Bidirectional RNNs

For numerous tasks in speech processing, it is more effective to process the whole utterance at once.
For instance, in speech recognition, one-shot input transcription can be more robust than transcribing based on the partial (i.e.
previous) context information \cite{graves2013speech}.
The vanilla RNN has a limitation in such cases as they are unidirectional in nature, that is, output $y_t$ is obtained from $\{x_k\}_{k=1}^{t}$, and thus, agnostic of what comes after time $t$.
Bidirectional RNNs (BRNNs) were proposed to overcome such shortcomings of RNNs \cite{schuster1997bidirectional}.
BRRNs encode both future and past (input) context in separate hidden layers.
The outputs of the two RNNs are then combined at each time step, typically by concatenating them together, to create a new, richer representation that includes both past and future context.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \overrightarrow{h_{t}} &= \mathcal{H}(W_{\overrightarrow{hh}}\overrightarrow{h}_{t-1}+W_{\overrightarrow{xh}}x_{t}+b_{\overrightarrow{h}})\\
    \overleftarrow{h_{t}} &= \mathcal{H}(W_{\overleftarrow{hh}}\overleftarrow{h}_{t+1}+W_{\overleftarrow{xh}}x_{t}+b_{\overleftarrow{h}})\\
    y_{t} &= W_{\overrightarrow{hy}}\overrightarrow{h}_{t}+W_{\overleftarrow{hy}}\overleftarrow{h}_{t}+b_y
\end{aligned}
$$

where high dimensional hidden states $\overrightarrow{h}_{t-1}$ and $\overleftarrow{h}_{t+1}$ are hidden states modeling the forward context from $1,2,\ldots,t-1$ and backward context from $T, T-1, \ldots, t+1$, respectively.

#### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

Vanilla RNNs are observed to face another limitation, that is, vanishing gradients that do not allow them to learn from long-range context information.
To overcome this, a variant of RNN, named as LSTM, was specifically designed to address the vanishing gradient problem and enable the network to selectively retain (or forget) information over longer periods of time \cite{hochreiter1997long}.
This attribute is achieved by maintaining separate purpose-built memory cells in the network: the long-term memory cell $c_t$ and the short-term memory cell $h_t$.
In Eq of RNN(h), LSTM redefines the operator $\mathcal{H}$ in terms of forget gate $f_t$, input gate $i_t$, and output gate $o_t$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    i_t &= \sigma(W_{xi}x_t + W_{hi}h_{t-1}+W_{ci}c_{t-1}+b_i),\\
    f_t &= \sigma(W_{xf}x_t + W_{hf}h_{t-1}+W_{cf}c_{t-1}+b_f),\\
    c_t &= f_t\odot c_{t-1} + i_t\odot \tanh{(W_{xc}x_t+W_{hc}h_{t-1}+b_c)},\\
    o_t &= \sigma(W_{xo}x_t + W_{ho}h_{t-1}+W_{co}c_{t}+b_o),\\
    h_t &= o_t\odot \tanh{(c_t)},
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\sigma(x)=1/({1+e^{-x}})$ is a logistic sigmoid activation function.
$c_t$ is a fusion of the information from the previous state of the long-term memory $c_{t-1}$, the previous state of short-term memory $h_{t-1}$, and current input $x_t$.
$W$ and $b$ are weight matrices and biases.
$\odot$ is the element-wise vector multiplication or Hadamard operator.
Bidirectional LSTMs (BLSTMs) can capture longer contexts in both forward and backward directions \cite{graves2012sequence}.


#### Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)

Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) aim to be a computationally-efficient approximate of LSTM by using only two gates (vs three in LSTM) and a single memory cell (vs two in LSTM).
To control the flow of information over time, a GRU uses an update gate $z_t$ to decide how much of the new input to be added to the previous hidden state and a reset gate $r_t$ to decide how much of previous hidden state information to be forgotten.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    z_{t} &= \sigma(W_{xz}x_{t} + W_{hz}h_{t-1}),\\
    r_{t} &= \sigma(W_{xr}x_{t} + W_{hr}h_{t-1}), \\
    h_{t} &= (1-z_{t})\odot h_{t-1} + z_{t}\odot \tanh(W_{xh}x_{t} + W_{rh}(r_{t}\odot h_{t-1})),
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\odot$ is element-wise multiplication between the two vectors (Hadamard product).

RNNs and their variants are widely used in various deep learning applications like speech recognition, synthesis, and natural language understanding.
Although seq2seq based on recurrent architectures such as LSTM/GRU has made great strides in speech processing, they suffer from the drawback of slow training speed due to internal recurrence.
Another drawback of the RNN family is their inability to leverage information from long distant time steps accurately.

#### Connectionist Temporal Classification

Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) \cite{graves2012connectionist} is a scoring and output function commonly used to train LSTM networks for sequence-based problems with variable timing.
CTC has been applied to several tasks, including phoneme recognition, ASR, and other sequence-based problems.
One of the major benefits of CTC is its ability to handle unknown alignment between input and output, simplifying the training process.
When used in ASR  \cite{9688009,9747887,9053165}, CTC eliminates the need for manual data labeling by assigning probability scores to the output given any input signal.
This is particularly advantageous for tasks such as speech recognition and handwriting recognition, where the input and output can vary in size.
CTC also solves the problem of having to specify the position of a character in the output, allowing for more efficient training of the neural network without post-processing the output.
Finally, the CTC decoder can transform the neural network output into the final text without post-processing.

### 3.1.2路Application

The utilization of RNNs in popular products such as Google's voice search and Apple's Siri to process user input and predict the output has been well-documented \cite{he2017streaming,li2017acoustic}.
RNNs are frequently utilized in speech recognition tasks, such as the prediction of phonetic segments from audio signals \cite{papastratis2021speech}.
They excel in use cases where context plays a vital role in outcome prediction and are distinct from CNNs as they utilize feedback loops to process a data sequence that informs the final output \cite{papastratis2021speech}.

In recent times, there have been advancements in the architecture of RNNs, which have been primarily focused on developing end-to-end (E2E) models \cite{li2020towards,9746187} for ASR.
These E2E models have replaced conventional hybrid models and have displayed substantial enhancements in speech recognition \cite{li2020towards,li2021better}.
However, a significant challenge faced by E2E RNN models is the synchronization of the input speech sequence with the output label sequence \cite{graves2012sequence}.
To tackle this issue, a loss function called CTC \cite{graves2012connectionist} is utilized for training RNN models, allowing for the repetition of labels to construct paths of the same length as the input speech sequence.
An alternative method is to employ an Attention-based Encoder-Decoder (AED) model based on RNN architecture, which utilizes an attention mechanism to align the input speech sequence with the output label sequence.
However, AED models tend to perform poorly on lengthy utterances.

The development of Bimodal Recurrent Neural Networks (BRNN) has led to significant advancements in the field of Audiovisual Speech Activity Detection (AV-SAD) \cite{tao2019end}.
BRNNs have demonstrated immense potential in improving the performance of speech recognition systems, particularly in noisy environments, by combining information from various sources.
By integrating separate RNNs for each modality, BRNNs can capture temporal dependencies within and across modalities.
This leads to successful outcomes in speech-based systems, where integrating audio and visual modalities is crucial for accurate speech recognition.
Compared to conventional audio-only systems, BRNN-based AV-SAD systems display superior performance, particularly in challenging acoustic conditions where audio-only systems might struggle.

To enhance the performance of continuous speech recognition, LSTM networks have been utilized in hybrid architectures alongside CNNs \cite{passricha2019hybrid}.
The CNNs extract local features from speech frames that are then processed by LSTMs over time \cite{passricha2019hybrid}.
LSTMs have also been employed for speech synthesis, where they have been shown to enhance the quality of statistical parametric speech synthesis \cite{passricha2019hybrid}.

Aside from their ASR and speech synthesis applications, LSTM networks have been utilized for speech post-filtering.
To improve the quality of synthesized speech, researchers have proposed deep learning-based post-filters, with LSTMs demonstrating superior performance over other post-filter types \cite{coto2019improving}.
Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) is another variant of RNN that has been widely used for speech synthesis \cite{fan2014tts}.
Several RNN-based analysis/synthesis models such as WaveNet \cite{oord2016wavenet}, SampleRNN \cite{mehri2016samplernn}, and Tacotron have been developed.
These neural vocoder models can generate high-quality synthesized speech from acoustic features without requiring intermediate vocoding steps.

## 3.2路Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a specialized class of deep neural architecture consisting of one or more pairs of alternating convolutional and pooling layers.
A convolution layer applies filters that process small local parts of the input, where these filters are replicated along the whole input space.
A pooling layer converts convolution layer activations to low resolution by taking the maximum filter activation within a specified
window and shifting across the activation map.
CNNs are variants of fully connected neural networks widely used for processing data with grid-like topology.
For example, time-series data (1D grid) with samples at regular intervals or images (2D grid) with pixels constitute a grid-like structure.

As discussed in [Sec.02](Sec.02.md), the speech spectrogram retains more information than hand-crafted features, including speaker characteristics such as vocal tract length differences across speakers, distinct speaking styles causing formant to undershoot or overshoot, etc.
Also, explicitly expressed these characteristics in the frequency domain.
The spectrogram representation shows very strong correlations in time and frequency.
Due to these characteristics of the spectrogram, it is a suitable input for a CNN processing pipeline that requires preserving locality in both frequency and time axis.
For speech signals, modeling local correlations with CNNs will be beneficial.
The CNNs can also effectively extract the structural features from the spectrogram and reduce the complexity of the model through weight sharing.
This section will discuss the architecture of 1D and 2D CNNs used in various speech-processing tasks.

### 3.2.1路CNN Model Variants

#### 2D CNN

Since spectrograms are two-dimensional visual representations, one can leverage CNN architectures widely used for visual data processing (images and videos) by performing convolutions in two dimensions.

The mathematical equation for a 2D convolutional layer can be represented as:

$$
y_{i,j}^{(k)}= \sigma\Big(\sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{m=1}^{M} x_{i+l-1,j+m-1}^{(l)} w_{l,m}^{(k)} + b^{(k)}\Big)
$$

Here, $x_{i,j}^{(l)}$ is the pixel value of the $l^{th}$ input channel at the spatial location $(i,j)$, $w_{l,m}^{(k)}$ is the weight of the $m^{th}$ filter at the $l^{th}$ channel producing the $k^{th}$ feature map, and $b^{(k)}$ is the bias term for the $k^{th}$ feature map.

The output feature map $y_{i,j}^{(k)}$ is obtained by convolving the input image with the filters and then applying an activation function $\sigma$ to introduce non-linearity.
The convolution operation involves sliding the filter window over the input image, computing the dot product between the filter and the input pixels at each location, and producing a single output pixel.

However, there are some drawbacks to using a 2D CNN for speech processing.
One of the main issues is that 2D convolutions are computationally expensive, especially for large inputs.
This is because 2D convolutions involve many multiplications and additions, and the computational cost grows quickly with the input size.

To address this issue, a 1D CNN can be designed to operate directly on the speech signal without needing a spectrogram.
1D convolutions are much less computationally expensive than 2D convolutions because they only operate on one dimension of the input.
This reduces the multiplications and additions required, making the network faster and more efficient.
In addition, 1D feature maps require less memory during processing, which is especially important for real-time applications.
A neural network's memory requirements are proportional to its feature maps' size.
By using 1D convolutions, the size of the feature maps can be significantly reduced, which can improve the efficiency of the network and reduce the memory requirements.

#### 1D CNN

1D CNN is essentially a special case of 2D CNN where the height of the filter is equal to the height the spectogram.
Thus, the filter only slides along the temporal dimension and the height of the resultant feature maps is one.
As such, 1D convolutions are computationally less expensive and memory efficient~\cite{KIRANYAZ2021107398}, as compared to 2D CNNs.
Several studies \cite{kiranyaz2015convolutional,Karita2019ImprovingTE,abdeljaber2017real} have shown that 1D CNNs are preferable to their 2D counterparts in certain applications.
For example, \citet{alsabhan2023human} found that the performance of predicting emotions with a 2D CNN model was lower compared to a 1D CNN model.

1D convolution is useful in speech processing for several reasons:

- Since, speech signals are sequences of amplitudes sampled over time, 1D convolution can be applied along temporal dimension to capture temporal variations in the signal.
- **Robustness to distortion and noise**:
  Since, 1D convolution allows local feature extraction, the resultant features are often resilient to global distortions of the signal.
  For instance, a speaker might be interrupted in the middle of an utterance.
  Local features would still produce robust representations for those relevant spans, which is key to ASR, among many speech processing task.
  On the other hand, speech signals are often contaminated with noise, making extracting meaningful information difficult.
  1D convolution followed by pooling layers can mitigate the impact of noise~\cite{hendrycks2018benchmarking}, improving speech recognition systems' accuracy.

The basic building block of a 1D CNN is the convolutional layer, which applies a set of filters to the input data.
A convolutional layer employs a collection of adjustable parameters called filters to carry out convolution operations on the input data, resulting in a set of feature maps as the output, which represent the activation of each filter at each position in the input data.
The size of the feature maps depends on the size of the input data, the size of the filters, and the number of filters used.
The activation function used in a 1D CNN is typically a non-linear function, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU) function.

Given an input sequence $x$ of length $N$, a set of $K$ filters $W_k$ of length $M$, and a bias term $b_k$, the output feature map $y_k$ of the $k^{th}$ filter is given by

$$
    y_k[n]  = \ReLU(b_k + \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} W_k[m] * x[n-m])
$$

where $n$ ranges from $M-1$ to $N-1$, and $*$ denotes the convolution operation.
After the convolutional layer, the output tensor is typically passed through a pooling layer, reducing the feature maps' size by down-sampling.
The most commonly used pooling operation is the max-pooling, which keeps the maximum value from a sliding window across each feature map.

#### Summary

CNNs often replace previously popular methods like HMMs and GMM-UBM in various cases.
Moreover, CNNs possess the ability to acquire features that remain robust despite variations in speech signals resulting from diverse speakers, accents, and background noise.
This is made possible due to three key properties of CNNs: locality, weight sharing, and pooling.
The locality property enhances resilience against non-white noise by enabling the computation of effective features from cleaner portions of the spectrum.
Consequently, only a smaller subset of features is affected by the noise, allowing higher network layers a better opportunity to handle the noise by combining higher-level features computed for each frequency band.
This improvement over standard fully connected neural networks, which process all input features in the lower layers, highlights the significance of locality.
As a result, locality reduces the number of network weights that must be learned.

### 3.2.2路Application

CNNs have proven to be versatile tools for a range of speech-processing tasks.
They have been successfully applied to speech recognition \cite{nassif2019speech, 6857341}, including in hybrid NN-HMM models for speech recognition, and can be used for multi-class classification of words \cite{6288864}.
In addition, CNNs have been proposed for speaker recognition in an emotional speech, with a constrained CNN model presented in \cite{simic2022speaker}.

CNNs, both 1D and 2D, have emerged as the core building block for various speech processing models, including acoustic models \cite{schneider2019wav2vec,gulati2020conformer,kriman2020quartznet} in ASR systems.
For instance, in 2021, researchers from Facebook AI proposed wav2vec2.0 \cite{schneider2019wav2vec}, a hybrid ASR system based on CNNs for learning representations of raw speech signals that were then fed into a transformer-based language model.
The system achieved state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets.

Similarly, Google's VGGVox \cite{Nagrani17} used a CNN with VGG architecture to learn speaker embeddings from Mel spectrograms, achieving state-of-the-art results in speaker recognition.
CNNs have also been widely used in developing state-of-the-art speech enhancement and text-to-speech architectures.
For instance,
the architecture proposed in \cite{li2021real,tzinis2022remixit} for Deep Noise Suppression (DNS) \cite{reddy2020interspeech} challenge and Google's Tacotron2 \cite{shen2018natural} are examples of models that use CNNs as their core building blocks.
In addition to traditional tasks like ASR and speaker identification, CNNs have also been applied to non-traditional speech processing tasks like emotion recognition \cite{kakuba2022deep}, Parkinson's disease detection \cite{johri2019parkinson}, language identification \cite{singh2021spoken} and sleep apnea detection \cite{simply2019diagnosis}.
In all these tasks, CNN extracted features from speech signals and fed them into the task classification model.
