# 01: Introduction

Humans employ language as a means to effectively convey their emotions and sentiments.
Language encompasses a collection of words forming a vocabulary, accompanied by grammar, which dictates the appropriate usage of these words.
It manifests in various forms, including written text, sign language, and spoken communication.
Speech, specifically, entails the utilization of phonetic combinations of consonant and vowel sounds to articulate words from the vocabulary.
Phonetics, in turn, pertains to the production and perception of sounds by individuals.
Through speech, individuals are able to express themselves and convey meaning in their chosen language.

Speech processing is a field dedicated to the study and application of methods for analyzing and manipulating speech signals.
It encompasses a range of tasks, including automatic speech recognition (ASR) \cite{yu2016automatic, nassif2019speech}, speaker recognition (SR) \cite{bai2021speaker}, and speech synthesis or text-to-speech \cite{ning2019review}.
In recent years, speech processing has garnered increasing significance due to its diverse applications in areas such as telecommunications, healthcare, and entertainment.
Notably, statistical modeling techniques, particularly Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), have played a pivotal role in advancing the field \cite{gales2008application, rabiner1989tutorial}.
These models have paved the way for significant advancements and breakthroughs in speech processing research and development.

Over the past few years, the field of speech processing has been transformed by introducing powerful tools, including deep learning.
\Cref{fig:evolution} illustrates the evolution of speech processing models over the years, the rapid development of deep learning architecture for speech processing reflects the growing complexity and diversity of the field.
This technology has revolutionized the analysis and processing of speech signals using deep neural networks (DNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
These architectures have proven highly effective in various speech-processing applications, such as speech recognition, speaker recognition, and speech synthesis.
This study comprehensively overviews the most critical and emerging deep-learning techniques and their potential applications in various speech-processing tasks.

Deep learning has revolutionized speech processing by its ability to automatically learn meaningful features from raw speech signals, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering.
This breakthrough has led to significant advancements in speech processing performance, particularly in challenging scenarios involving noise, as well as diverse accents and dialects.
By leveraging the power of deep neural networks, speech processing systems can now adapt and generalize more effectively, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness in various applications.
The inherent capability of deep learning to extract intricate patterns and representations from speech data has opened up new possibilities for tackling real-world speech processing challenges.

Deep learning architectures have emerged as powerful tools in speech processing, offering remarkable improvements in various tasks.
Pioneering studies, such as \cite{hinton2012deep}, have demonstrated the substantial gains achieved by deep neural networks (DNNs) in speech recognition accuracy compared to traditional HMM-based systems.
Complementing this, research in \cite{abdel2014convolutional} showcased the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for speech recognition.
Moreover, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have proven their efficacy in both speech recognition and synthesis, as highlighted in \cite{graves2013speech}.
Recent advancements in deep learning have further enhanced speech processing systems, with attention mechanisms \cite{chorowski2015attention} and transformers \cite{vaswani2017attention} playing significant roles.
Attention mechanisms enable the model to focus on salient sections of the input signal, while transformers facilitate modeling long-range dependencies within the signal.
These developments have led to substantial improvements in the performance and versatility of speech processing systems, unlocking new possibilities for applications in diverse domains.

Although deep learning has made remarkable progress in speech processing, it still faces certain challenges that need to be addressed.
These challenges include the requirement for substantial amounts of labeled data, the interpretability of the models, and their robustness to different environmental conditions.
To provide a comprehensive understanding of the advancements in this domain, this paper presents an extensive overview of deep learning architectures employed in speech-processing applications.
Speech processing encompasses the analysis, synthesis, and recognition of speech signals, and the integration of deep learning techniques has led to significant advancements in these areas.
By examining the current state-of-the-art approaches, this paper aims to shed light on the potential of deep learning for tackling the existing challenges and further advancing speech processing research.

The paper provides a comprehensive exploration of deep-learning architectures in the field of speech processing.
It begins by establishing the background, encompassing the definition of speech signals, speech features, and traditional non-neural models.
Subsequently, the focus shifts towards an in-depth examination of various deep-learning architectures specifically tailored for speech processing, including RNNs, CNNs, Transformers, GNNs, and diffusion models.

By thoroughly analyzing the fundamentals, model architectures, and specific tasks within the field, the paper then progresses to discuss advanced transfer learning techniques, including domain adaptation, meta-learning, and parameter-efficient transfer learning.

Finally, in the conclusion, the paper reflects on the current state of the field and identifies potential future directions.
By considering emerging trends and novel approaches, the paper aims to shed light on the evolving landscape of deep learning in speech processing and provide insights into promising avenues for further research and development.

**Why this paper?**
Deep learning has become a powerful tool in speech processing because it automatically learns high-level representations of speech signals from raw audio data.
As a result, significant advancements have been made in various speech-processing tasks, including speech recognition, speaker identification, speech synthesis, and more.
These tasks are essential in various applications, such as human-computer interaction, speech-based search, and assistive technology for people with speech impairments.
For example, virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa use speech recognition technology, while audiobooks and in-car navigation systems rely on text-to-speech systems.

Given the wide range of applications and the rapidly evolving nature of deep learning, a comprehensive review paper that surveys the current state-of-the-art techniques and their applications in speech processing is necessary.
Such a paper can help researchers and practitioners stay up-to-date with the latest developments and trends and provide insights into potential areas for future research.
However, to the best of our knowledge, no current work covers a broad spectrum of speech-processing tasks.
