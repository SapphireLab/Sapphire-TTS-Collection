## 1·Introduction: 引言

Humans employ language as a means to effectively convey their emotions and sentiments.
Language encompasses a collection of words forming a vocabulary, accompanied by grammar, which dictates the appropriate usage of these words.
It manifests in various forms, including written text, sign language, and spoken communication.
Speech, specifically, entails the utilization of phonetic combinations of consonant and vowel sounds to articulate words from the vocabulary.
Phonetics, in turn, pertains to the production and perception of sounds by individuals.
Through speech, individuals are able to express themselves and convey meaning in their chosen language.

Speech processing is a field dedicated to the study and application of methods for analyzing and manipulating speech signals.
It encompasses a range of tasks, including automatic speech recognition (ASR) \cite{yu2016automatic, nassif2019speech}, speaker recognition (SR) \cite{bai2021speaker}, and speech synthesis or text-to-speech \cite{ning2019review}.

# 2·Background

Before moving on to deep neural architectures, we discuss basic terms used in speech processing, low-level representations of speech signals, and traditional models used in the field.

## 2.1·Speech Signals

Signal processing is a fundamental discipline that encompasses the study of quantities that exhibit variations in space or time.
In the realm of signal processing, a quantity exhibiting spatial or temporal variations is commonly referred to as a signal.
Specifically, sound signals are defined as variations in air pressure.
Consequently, a speech signal is identified as a type of sound signal, namely pressure variations, generated by humans to facilitate spoken communication.
Transducers play a vital role in converting these signals from one form, such as air pressure, to another form, typically an electrical signal.

In signal processing, a signal that repetitively manifests after a fixed duration, known as a period, is classified as periodic.
The reciprocal of this period represents the frequency of the signal.
The waveform of a periodic signal defines its shape and concurrently determines its timbre, which pertains to the subjective perception of sound quality by humans.
To facilitate the processing of speech, speech signals are commonly digitized.
This entails converting them into a series of numerical values by measuring the signal's amplitude at consistent time intervals.
The sampling rate, defined by the number of samples collected per second, determines the granularity of this digitization process.

## 2.2·Speech Features

Speech features are numerical representations of speech signals that are used for analysis, recognition, and synthesis.
Broadly, speech signals can be classified into two categories: **time-domain** features and **frequency-domain** features.

### Time-Domain Features

**Time-domain** features are derived directly from the amplitude of the speech signal over time.
These are simple to compute and often used in real-time speech-processing applications.
Some common time-domain features include:

- **Energy**: Energy is a quantitative measure of the amplitude characteristics of a speech signal over time.
It is computed by squaring each sample in the signal and summing them within a specific time window.
This captures the overall strength and dynamics of the signal, revealing temporal variations in intensity.
The energy measure provides insights into segments with higher or lower amplitudes, aiding in speech recognition, audio segmentation, and speaker diarization.
It also helps identify events and transitions indicative of changes in vocal activity.
By quantifying amplitude variations, energy analysis contributes to a comprehensive understanding of speech signals and their acoustic properties.
- **Zero-Crossing Rate**: The zero-crossing rate indicates how frequently the speech signal crosses the zero-axis within a defined time frame.
It is computed by counting the number of polarity changes in the signal during a specific window.
- **Pitch**: Pitch refers to the perceived tonal quality in a speaker's voice, which is determined by analyzing the fundamental frequency of the speech signal.
The fundamental frequency can be estimated through the application of pitch detection algorithms \cite{rabiner1976comparative} or by utilizing autocorrelation techniques \cite{tan2003pitch}.
- **Linear Predictive Coding (LPC)**: Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) is a powerful technique that represents the speech signal as a linear combination of past samples, employing an autoregressive model.
The estimation of model parameters is accomplished through methods like the Levinson-Durbin algorithm \cite{castiglioni2005levinson}.
The obtained coefficients serve as a valuable feature representation for various speech-processing tasks.

### Frequency-Domain Features

**Frequency-domain** features are derived from the signal represented in the frequency domain also known as its spectrum.
A spectrum captures the distribution of energy as a function of frequency.
Spectrograms are two-dimensional visual representations capturing the variations in a signal's spectrum over time.
When compared against time-domain features, it is generally more complex to compute frequency-domain features as they tend to involve time-frequency transform operations such as Fourier transform.

- **Mel-spectrogram**: A Mel spectrogram, also known as a Mel-frequency spectrogram or Melspectrogram, is a representation of the short-term power spectrum of a sound signal.
It is widely used in audio signal processing and speech recognition tasks.
It is obtained by converting the power spectrum of a speech signal into a mel-scale, which is a perceptual scale of pitches based on the human auditory system's response to different frequencies.
The mel-scale divides the frequency range into a set of mel-frequency bands, with higher resolution in the lower frequencies and coarser resolution in the higher frequencies.
This scale is designed to mimic the non-linear frequency perception of human hearing.
To compute the Melspectrogram, the speech signal is typically divided into short overlapping frames.
For each frame, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to obtain the power spectrum.
The power spectrum is then transformed into the mel-scale using a filterbank that converts the power values at different frequencies to their corresponding mel-frequency bands.
Finally, the logarithm of the mel-scale power values is computed, resulting in the Melspectrogram.
Melspectrogram provides a time-frequency representation of the audio signal, where the time dimension corresponds to the frame index, and the frequency dimension represents the mel-frequency bands.
It captures both the spectral content and temporal dynamics of the signal, making it useful for tasks such as speech recognition, music analysis, and sound classification.
By using the Melspectrogram, the representation of the audio signal is transformed to a more perceptually meaningful domain, which can enhance the performance of various audio processing algorithms.
It is particularly beneficial in scenarios where capturing the spectral patterns and frequency content of the signal is important for the analysis or classification task at hand.
- **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)**: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are a feature representation widely utilized in various applications such as speech recognition, gesture recognition, speaker identification, and cetacean auditory perception systems.
MFCCs capture the power spectrum of a sound over a short duration by utilizing a linear cosine transformation of a logarithmically-scaled power spectrum on a non-linear mel frequency scale.
The MFCCs consist of a set of coefficients that collectively form a Mel-frequency cepstrum ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum)).
With just 12 parameters related to the amplitude of frequencies, MFCCs provide an adequate number of frequency channels to analyze audio, while still maintaining a compact representation.
The main objectives of MFCC extraction are to eliminate vocal fold excitation (F0) information related to pitch, ensure the independence of the extracted features, align with human perception of loudness and frequency, and capture the contextual dynamics of phones.
The process of extracting MFCC features involves A/D conversion, pre-emphasis filtering, framing, windowing, Fourier transform, Mel filter bank application, logarithmic operation, discrete cosine transform (DCT), and liftering.
By following these steps, MFCCs enable the extraction of informative audio features while avoiding redundancy and preserving the relevant characteristics of the sound signal.

### Other Speech Features

Other types of speech features include formant frequencies, pitch contour, cepstral coefficients, wavelet coefficients, and spectral envelope.
These features can be used for various speech-processing tasks, including speech recognition, speaker identification, emotion recognition, and speech synthesis.

In the field of speech processing, frequency-based representations such as Mel spectrogram and MFCC are widely used since they are more robust to noise as compared to temporal variations of the sound \cite{9955539}.
Time-domain features can be useful when the task warrants this information (such as pauses, emotions, phoneme duration, and speech segments).
It is noteworthy that the time-domain and frequency-domain features tend to capture different sets of information and thus can be used in conjunction to solve a task \cite{1165240,9053712,tang2021joint}.

## 2.3·Traditional Models for Speech Processing

Traditional speech representation learning algorithms based on shallow models utilize basic non-parametric models for extracting features from speech signals.
The primary objective of these models is to extract significant features from the speech signal through mathematical operations, such as Fourier transforms, wavelet transforms, and linear predictive coding (LPC).
The extracted features serve as inputs to classification or regression models.
The shallow models aim to extract meaningful features from the speech signal, enabling the classification or regression model to learn and make accurate predictions.

### Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)

Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are powerful generative models employed to represent the probability distribution of a speech feature vector.
They achieve this by combining multiple Gaussian distributions with different weights.
GMMs have found widespread applications in speaker identification \cite{kinnunen2005real} and speech recognition tasks \cite{reynolds2003channel}.
Specifically, in speaker identification, GMMs are utilized to capture the distribution of speaker-specific features, enabling the recognition of individuals based on their unique characteristics.
Conversely, in speech recognition, GMMs are employed to model the acoustic properties of speech sounds, facilitating accurate recognition of spoken words and phrases.
GMMs play a crucial role in these domains, enabling robust and efficient analysis of speech-related data.

### Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a widely adopted class of supervised learning algorithms extensively utilized for various speech classification tasks \cite{smith2001speech}.
They are particularly effective in domains like speaker recognition  \cite{hatch2006within,solomonoff2004channel,solomonoff2005advances} and phoneme recognition \cite{campbell2003phonetic}.
SVMs excel in their ability to identify optimal hyperplanes that effectively separate different classes in the feature space.
By leveraging this optimal separation, SVMs enable accurate classification and recognition of speech patterns.
As a result, SVMs have become a fundamental tool in the field of speech analysis and play a vital role in enhancing the performance of speech-related classification tasks.

### Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have gained significant popularity as a powerful tool for performing various speech recognition tasks, particularly ASR \cite{gales2008application, rabiner1989tutorial}.
In ASR, HMMs are employed to model the probability distribution of speech sounds by incorporating a sequential arrangement of hidden states along with corresponding observations.
The training of HMMs is commonly carried out using the Baum-Welch algorithm, a variant of the Expectation Maximization algorithm, which enables effective parameter estimation and model optimization [Wikipedia: Baum-Welch algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baum\%e2\%80\%93Welch\_algorithm).
By leveraging HMMs in speech recognition, it becomes possible to predict the most likely sequence of speech sounds given an input speech signal.
This enables accurate and efficient recognition of spoken language, making HMMs a crucial component in advancing speech recognition technology.
Their flexibility and ability to model temporal dependencies contribute to their widespread use in ASR and various other speech-related applications, further enhancing our understanding and utilization of spoken language.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple yet effective classification approach utilized in a wide range of speech-related applications, including speaker recognition \cite{sadjadi2014nearest} and language recognition.
The core principle of KNN involves identifying the K-nearest neighbors of a given input feature vector within the training data and assigning it to the class that appears most frequently among those neighbors.
This algorithm has gained significant popularity due to its practicality and intuitive nature, making it a reliable choice for classifying speech data in numerous real-world scenarios.
By leveraging the proximity-based classification, KNN provides a straightforward yet powerful method for accurately categorizing speech samples based on their similarities to the training data.
Its versatility and ease of implementation contribute to its widespread adoption in various speech-related domains, facilitating advancements in speaker recognition, language identification, and other applications in the field of speech processing.

### Decision Trees

Decision trees are widely employed in speech classification tasks as a class of supervised learning algorithms.
Their operation involves recursively partitioning the feature space into smaller regions, guided by the values of the features.
Within each partition, a decision rule is established to assign the input feature vector to a specific class.
The strength of decision trees lies in their ability to capture complex decision boundaries by hierarchically dividing the feature space.
By analyzing the values of the input features at each node, decision trees efficiently navigate the classification process.
This approach not only provides interpretability, but also facilitates the identification of key features contributing to the classification outcome.
Through their recursive partitioning mechanism, decision trees offer a flexible and versatile framework for speech classification.
They excel in scenarios where the decision rules are based on discernible thresholds or ranges of feature values.
The simplicity and transparency of decision trees make them a valuable tool for understanding and solving speech-related classification tasks.

### Summary

To summarize, conventional speech representation learning algorithms based on shallow models entail feature extraction from the speech signal, which is subsequently used as input for classification or regression models.
These algorithms have found extensive applications in speech processing tasks like speech recognition, speaker identification, and speech synthesis.
However, they have been progressively superseded by more advanced representation learning algorithms, particularly deep neural networks, due to their enhanced capabilities.

## 7·Conclusion and Future Research Directions

The rapid advancements in deep learning techniques have revolutionized speech processing tasks, enabling significant progress in speech recognition, speaker recognition, and speech synthesis.
This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest developments in deep learning techniques for speech-processing tasks.
We begin by examining the early developments in speech processing, including representation learning and HMM-based modeling, before presenting a concise summary of fundamental deep learning techniques and their applications in speech processing.
Furthermore, we discuss key speech-processing tasks, highlight the datasets used in these tasks, and present the latest and most relevant research works utilizing deep learning techniques.


We envisage several lines of development in speech processing:

- **Large Speech Models**: In addition to the advancements made with wav2vec2.0, further progress in the field of ASR and TTS models involves the development of larger and more comprehensive models, along with the utilization of larger datasets.
By leveraging these resources, it becomes possible to create TTS models that exhibit enhanced naturalness and human-like prosody.
One promising approach to achieve this is through the application of adversarial training, where a discriminator is employed to distinguish between machine-generated speech and reference speech.
This adversarial framework facilitates the generation of TTS models that closely resemble human speech, providing a significant step forward in achieving more realistic and high-quality synthesized speech.
By exploring these avenues, researchers aim to push the boundaries of speech synthesis technology, ultimately enhancing the overall performance and realism of TTS systems.
- **Multilingual Models**: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a transformative approach in the field of speech recognition, particularly for low-resource languages characterized by scarce or unavailable labeled datasets.
The recent development of the XLS-R model, a state-of-the-art self-supervised speech recognition model, represents a significant milestone in this domain.
With a remarkable scale of over 2 billion parameters, the XLS-R model has been trained on a diverse dataset spanning 128 languages, surpassing its predecessor in terms of language coverage.
The notable advantage of scaling up larger multilingual models like XLS-R lies in the substantial performance improvements they offer.
As a result, these models are poised to outperform single-language models and hold immense promise for the future of speech recognition.
By harnessing the power of self-supervised learning and leveraging multilingual datasets, the XLS-R model showcases the potential for addressing the challenges posed by low-resource languages and advancing the field of speech recognition to new heights.
- **Multimodal Speech Models**: Traditional speech and text models have typically operated within a single modality, focusing solely on either speech or text inputs and outputs.
However, as the scale of generative models continues to grow exponentially, the integration of multiple modalities becomes a natural progression.
This trend is evident in the latest developments, such as the unveiling of groundbreaking language models like GPT-4~\cite{OpenAI2023GPT4TR} and Kosmos-I~\cite{Huang2023LanguageIN}, which demonstrate the ability to process both images and text jointly.
These pioneering multimodal models pave the way for the emergence of large-scale architectures that can seamlessly handle speech and other modalities in a unified manner.
The convergence of multiple modalities within a single model opens up new avenues for comprehensive understanding and generation of multimodal content, and it is highly anticipated that we will witness the rapid development of large multimodal models tailored for speech and beyond in the near future.
- **In-Context Learning**: Utilizing mixed-modality models opens up possibilities for the development of in-context learning approaches for a wide range of speech-related tasks.
This paradigm allows the tasks to be explicitly defined within the input, along with accompanying examples.
Remarkable progress has already been demonstrated in large language models (LLMs), including notable works such as InstructGPT~\cite{Ouyang2022TrainingLM}, FLAN-T5~\cite{Chung2022ScalingIL}, and LLaMA~\cite{Touvron2023LLaMAOA}.
These models showcase the efficacy of in-context learning, where the integration of context-driven information empowers the models to excel in various speech tasks.
By leveraging mixed-modality models and incorporating contextual cues, researchers are advancing the boundaries of speech processing capabilities, paving the way for more versatile and context-aware speech systems.
- **Controllable Speech Generation**:An intriguing application stemming from the aforementioned concept is controllable text-to-speech (TTS), which allows for fine-grained control over various attributes of the synthesized speech.
Attributes such as tone, accent, age, gender, and more can be precisely controlled through in-context text guidance.
This controllability in TTS opens up exciting possibilities for personalization and customization, enabling users to tailor the synthesized speech to their specific requirements.
By leveraging advanced models and techniques, researchers are making significant strides in developing controllable TTS systems that provide users with a powerful and flexible speech synthesis experience.
- **Parameter-efficient Learning**: With the increasing scale of LLMs and speech models, it becomes imperative to adapt these models with minimal parameter updates.
This necessitates the development of specialized adapters that can efficiently update these emerging mixed-modality large models.
Additionally, model compression techniques have proven to be practical solutions in addressing the challenges posed by these large models.
Recent research~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2106-05933, 9053878, peng-etal-2021-shrinking} has demonstrated the effectiveness of model compression, highlighting the sparsity that exists within these models, particularly for specific tasks.
By employing model compression techniques, researchers can reduce the computational requirements and memory footprint of these models while preserving their performance, making them more practical and accessible for real-world applications.
- **Explainability**: Explainability remains elusive to these large networks as they grow.
Researchers are steadfast in explaining these networks' functioning and learning dynamics.
Recently, much work has been done to learn the fine-tuning and in-context learning dynamics of these large models for text under the neural-tangent-kernel (NTK) asymptotic framework~\cite{Malladi2022AKV}.
Such exploration is yet to be done in the speech domain.
More yet, explainability could be built-in as inductive bias in architecture.
To this end, brain-inspired architectures~\cite{millet2022toward} are being developed, which may shed more light on this aspect of large models.
- **Neuroscience-inspired Architectures**:In recent years, there has been significant research exploring the parallels between speech-processing architectures and the intricate workings of the human brain~\cite{millet2022toward}.
These studies have unveiled compelling evidence of a strong correlation between the layers of speech models and the functional hierarchy observed in the human brain.
This intriguing finding has served as a catalyst for the development of neuroscience-inspired speech models that demonstrate comparable performance to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models~\cite{millet2022toward}.
By drawing inspiration from the underlying principles of neural processing in the human brain, these innovative speech models aim to enhance our understanding of speech perception and production while pushing the boundaries of performance in the field of speech processing.
- **Text-to-Audio Models for Text-to-Speech**: Lately, transformer and diffusion-based text-to-audio (TTA) model development is turning into an exciting area of research.
Until recently, most of these models~\cite {Liu2023AudioLDMTG,Kreuk2022AudioGenTG,yang2022diffsound,ghosal2023texttoaudio,wang2023audit} overlooked speech in favour of general audio.
In the future, however, the models will likely strive to be equally performant in both audio and speech.
To that end, current TTS methods will likely be an integral part of those models.
Recently, \citet{bark} have aimed at striking a good balance between general audio and speech, although their implementation is not public, nor have they provided any detailed paper.
