## Abstract

Recent developments in diffusion- and flow- based models have significantly advanced Text-to-Audio Generation (TTA). 
While achieving great synthesis quality and controllability, current TTA systems still suffer from slow inference speed, which significantly limits their practical applicability.

This paper presents MeanAudio, a novel MeanFlow-based model tailored for fast and faithful text-to-audio generation. 
Built on a Flux-style latent transformer, MeanAudio regresses the average velocity field during training, enabling fast generation by mapping directly from the start to the endpoint of the flow trajectory.
By incorporating classifier-free guidance (CFG) into the training target, MeanAudio incurs no additional cost in the guided sampling process. 
To further stabilize training, we propose an instantaneous-to-mean curriculum with flow field mix-up, which encourages the model to first learn the foundational instantaneous dynamics, and then gradually adapt to mean flows. 
This strategy proves critical for enhancing training efficiency and generation quality.
Experimental results demonstrate that MeanAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-step audio generation. 
Specifically, it achieves a real time factor (RTF) of 0.013 on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090, yielding a 100x speedup over SOTA diffusion-based TTA systems. 
Moreover, MeanAudio also demonstrates strong performance in multi-step generation, enabling smooth and coherent transitions across successive synthesis steps.
