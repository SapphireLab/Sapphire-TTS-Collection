## 摘要

We introduce ***RapFlow-TTS***, a rapid and high-fidelity TTS acoustic model that leverages velocity consistency constraints in Flow Matching (FM) training.
Although ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based TTS generation achieves natural-quality speech, it typically requires a large number of generation steps, resulting in a trade-off between quality and inference speed.
To address this challenge, ***RapFlow-TTS*** enforces consistency in the velocity field along the FM-straightened ODE trajectory, enabling consistent synthetic quality with fewer generation steps.
Additionally, we introduce techniques such as time interval scheduling and adversarial learning to further enhance the quality of the few-step synthesis.
Experimental results show that ***RapFlow-TTS*** achieves high-fidelity speech synthesis with a 5- and 10-fold reduction in synthesis steps than the conventional FM- and score-based approaches, respectively.
