## Abstract: 摘要

<table><tr><td width="50%">

In this paper we propose ***Flowtron***: an autoregressive flow-based generative network for text-to-speech synthesis with control over speech variation and style transfer.
***Flowtron** borrows insights from **IAF** and revamps **Tacotron** in order to provide high-quality and expressive mel-spectrogram synthesis.
***Flowtron*** is optimized by maximizing the likelihood of the training data, which makes training simple and stable.
***Flowtron*** learns an invertible mapping of data to a latent space that can be manipulated to control many aspects of speech synthesis (pitch, tone, speech rate, cadence, accent).
Our mean opinion scores (MOS) show that ***Flowtron*** matches state-of-the-art TTS models in terms of speech quality.
In addition, we provide results on control of speech variation, interpolation between samples and style transfer between speakers seen and unseen during training.
Code and pre-trained models will be made publicly available at this https URL.
