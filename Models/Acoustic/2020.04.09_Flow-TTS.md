## Abstract: 摘要

<table><tr><td width="50%">

In this work, we propose ***Flow-TTS***, a non-autoregressive end-to-end neural TTS model based on generative flow.
Unlike other non-autoregressive models, ***Flow-TTS*** can achieve high-quality speech generation by using a single feed-forward network.
To our knowledge, ***Flow-TTS*** is the first TTS model utilizing flow in spectrogram generation network and the first non-autoregressive model which jointly learns the alignment and spectrogram generation through a single network.
Experiments on **LJSpeech** show that the speech quality of ***Flow-TTS*** heavily approaches that of human and is even better than that of autoregressive model **Tacotron2** (outperforms **Tacotron2** with a gap of 0.09 in MOS).
Meanwhile, the inference speed of ***Flow-TTS*** is about 23 times speed-up over **Tacotron2**, which is comparable to **FastSpeech**.
