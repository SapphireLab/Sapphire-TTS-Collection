## Abstract: 摘要

In this work, we propose Flow-TTS, a non-autoregressive end-to-end neural TTS model based on generative flow.
Unlike other non-autoregressive models, Flow-TTS can achieve high-quality speech generation by using a single feed-forward network.
To our knowledge, Flow-TTS is the first TTS model utilizing flow in spectrogram generation network and the first non-autoregressive model which jointly learns the alignment and spectrogram generation through a single network.
Experiments on LJSpeech show that the speech quality of Flow-TTS heavily approaches that of human and is even better than that of autoregressive model Tacotron 2 (outperforms Tacotron 2 with a gap of 0.09 in MOS).
Meanwhile, the inference speed of Flow-TTS is about 23 times speed-up over Tacotron 2, which is comparable to FastSpeech.
