## Abstract

Current dialogue generation approaches typically require the complete dialogue text before synthesis and produce a single, inseparable speech containing all voices, making them unsuitable for interactive chat; moreover, they suffer from unstable synthesis, inaccurate speaker transitions, and incoherent prosody.

In this work, we present FireRedTTS‑2, a long-form streaming TTS system for multi-speaker dialogue generation, delivering stable, natural speech with reliable speaker switching and context-aware prosody.
A new 12.5Hz streaming speech tokenizer accelerates training and inference, extends maximum dialogue length, encodes richer semantics to stabilize text-to-token modeling and supports high-fidelity streaming generation for real-time applications.
We adopt a text–speech interleaved format, concatenating speaker-labeled text with aligned speech tokens in chronological order, and model it with a dual-transformer: a large decoder-only transformer predicts tokens at the first layer, and a smaller one completes subsequent layers.
Experimental results show that FireRedTTS‑2 integrates seamlessly with chat frameworks and, with minimal fine-tuning, produces emotionally expressive speech guided by implicit contextual cues.
In podcast generation, it surpasses existing systems including MoonCast, Zipvoice-Dialogue, and MOSS-TTSD in objective intelligibility, speaker-turn reliability, and perceived naturalness with context-consistent prosody.
