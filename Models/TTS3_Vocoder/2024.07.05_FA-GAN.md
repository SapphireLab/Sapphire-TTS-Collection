## Abstract: 摘要

> Generative adversarial network (GAN) based vocoders have achieved significant attention in speech synthesis with high quality and fast inference speed. 
> However, there still exist many noticeable spectral artifacts, resulting in the quality decline of synthesized speech. 
> In this work, we adopt a novel GAN-based vocoder designed for few artifacts and high fidelity, called ***FA-GAN***. 
> To suppress the aliasing artifacts caused by non-ideal upsampling layers in high-frequency components, we introduce the anti-aliased twin deconvolution module in the generator. 
> To alleviate blurring artifacts and enrich the reconstruction of spectral details, we propose a novel fine-grained multi-resolution real and imaginary loss to assist in the modeling of phase information. 
> Experimental results reveal that ***FA-GAN*** outperforms the compared approaches in promoting audio quality and alleviating spectral artifacts, and exhibits superior performance when applied to unseen speaker scenarios.
