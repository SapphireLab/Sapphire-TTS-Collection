## Abstract: 摘要

> Recently, universal waveform generation tasks have been investigated conditioned on various out-of-distribution scenarios. 
> Although GAN-based methods have shown their strength in fast waveform generation, they are vulnerable to train-inference mismatch scenarios such as two-stage text-to-speech. 
> Meanwhile, diffusion-based models have shown their powerful generative performance in other domains; however, they stay out of the limelight due to slow inference speed in waveform generation tasks. 
> Above all, there is no generator architecture that can explicitly disentangle the natural periodic features of high-resolution waveform signals. 
> In this paper, we propose PeriodWave, a novel universal waveform generation model. 
> First, we introduce a period-aware flow matching estimator that can capture the periodic features of the waveform signal when estimating the vector fields. 
> Additionally, we utilize a multi-period estimator that avoids overlaps to capture different periodic features of waveform signals. 
> Although increasing the number of periods can improve the performance significantly, this requires more computational costs. 
> To reduce this issue, we also propose a single period-conditional universal estimator that can feed-forward parallel by period-wise batch inference. 
> Additionally, we utilize discrete wavelet transform to losslessly disentangle the frequency information of waveform signals for high-frequency modeling, and introduce FreeU to reduce the high-frequency noise for waveform generation. 
> The experimental results demonstrated that our model outperforms the previous models both in Mel-spectrogram reconstruction and text-to-speech tasks.
