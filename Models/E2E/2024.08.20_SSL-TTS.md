## Abstract: 摘要

> While recent zero-shot multispeaker text-to-speech (TTS) models achieve impressive results, they typically rely on extensive transcribed speech datasets from numerous speakers and intricate training pipelines. Meanwhile, self-supervised learning (SSL) speech features have emerged as effective intermediate representations for TTS. It was also observed that SSL features from different speakers that are linearly close share phonetic information while maintaining individual speaker identity, which enables straight-forward and robust voice cloning. In this study, we introduce SSL-TTS, a lightweight and efficient zero-shot TTS framework trained on transcribed speech from a single speaker. SSL-TTS leverages SSL features and retrieval methods for simple and robust zero-shot multi-speaker synthesis. Objective and subjective evaluations show that our approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models that require significantly larger training datasets. The low training data requirements mean that SSL-TTS is well suited for the development of multi-speaker TTS systems for low-resource domains and languages. We also introduce an interpolation parameter which enables fine control over the output speech by blending voices.
