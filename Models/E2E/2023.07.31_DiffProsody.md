- 标题: Diffusion-based Latent Prosody Generation for Expressive Speech Synthesis with Prosody Conditional Adversarial Training

## Abstract: 摘要

> Expressive text-to-speech systems have undergone significant advancements owing to prosody modeling, but conventional methods can still be improved. 
> Traditional approaches have relied on the autoregressive method to predict the quantized prosody vector; however, it suffers from the issues of long-term dependency and slow inference. 
> This study proposes a novel approach called DiffProsody in which expressive speech is synthesized using a diffusion-based latent prosody generator and prosody conditional adversarial training. 
> Our findings confirm the effectiveness of our prosody generator in generating a prosody vector. 
> Furthermore, our prosody conditional discriminator significantly improves the quality of the generated speech by accurately emulating prosody. 
> We use denoising diffusion generative adversarial networks to improve the prosody generation speed. 
> Consequently, DiffProsody is capable of generating prosody 16 times faster than the conventional diffusion model. 
> The superior performance of our proposed method has been demonstrated via experiments.
