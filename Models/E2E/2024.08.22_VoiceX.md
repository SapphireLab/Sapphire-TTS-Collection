## Abstract: 摘要

> Modern TTS systems are capable of creating highly realistic and natural-sounding speech. 
> Despite these developments, the process of customizing TTS voices remains a complex task, mostly requiring the expertise of specialists within the field.
> One reason for this is the utilization of deep learning models, which are characterized by their expansive, non-interpretable parameter spaces, restricting the feasibility of manual customization.
> In this paper, we present a novel human-in-the-loop paradigm based on an evolutionary algorithm for directly interacting with the parameter space of a neural TTS model.
> We integrated our approach into a user-friendly graphical user interface that allows users to efficiently create original voices. 
> Those voices can then be used with the backbone TTS model, for which we provide a Python API.
> Further, we present the results of a user study exploring the capabilities of VoiceX. We show that VoiceX is an appropriate tool for creating individual, custom voices.

## 1.Introduction: 引言

> Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems are increasingly becoming an integral part of our daily lives. 
> They seamlessly integrate into a variety of fields, like virtual agents, social media platforms, video games, and accessibility applications such as screen readers or navigation systems \cite{abdulrahman2022natural,mertes2021potential, zhang2023does,henderson2022screen,sangale2022literature}.
> The speech quality of those TTS systems is steadily increasing, and the corresponding models are modified and extended in a variety of ways to equip them with even more capabilities, such as expressing voice-level emotions \cite{triantafyllopoulos2023overview} or even coping with multiple languages \cite{shang2021incorporating}.
> One of those abilities that got heavily improved over the last years is the \emph{Multi-Speaker capability}. 
> There, TTS models are not restricted to the synthesizing speech of one single voice. 
> Instead, they are conditioned on multiple speakers' voices, so that they can produce a variety of different voice timbres \cite{casanova2022yourtts,chen2020multispeech,casanova2021sc,cooper2020zero}.
>
> However, although those approaches possess the ability to generate a wide array of voices for different tasks, enabling users to fine-tune these voices to meet specific requirements presents a notable challenge.
> Typically, a subset of voices, selected in advance by software engineers or sound designers, is made available to end-users.
> If a user really wants to create a \emph{custom} voice that totally fits a certain use-case or need, there is commonly no possibility.
> Even if the user has proficient technical knowledge, there is still another problem: in most state-of-the-art neural TTS models, the voice timbre is encoded in intermediate, latent representations inside the TTS model and gets implicitly learned during training.
> As such, it is mostly not interpretable and therefore difficult to adapt.
>
> In this paper, we present a human-in-the-loop paradigm to easily search through the latent speaker embedding space of the state-of-the-art TTS system \emph{VITS} \cite{kim2021conditional}.
> Therefore, we introduce \emph{VoiceX}, a tool which iteratively presents users with pairs of distinct voices. 
> Starting with an initial comparison, users are simply required to select the voice that ``fits better'' to their preference. 
> These selections act as a feedback mechanism, forming the fitness function for an underlying Evolution Strategy (ES) algorithm (see Figure \ref{fig:ea_scheme}). 
> Through this iterative process, VoiceX effectively navigates the complex space of voice timbres, refining the selections to converge towards a voice that aligns closely with the user's specific requirements.
> We integrated VoiceX into a human-in-the-loop web application to make voice customization easily accessible.
> The system is designed to be easy to use, keeping cognitive load at a minimum, and as such being suitable to a broad spectrum of users.
> We evaluated our system in a user study (N=65). 
> There, we tested if users are capable of creating voices of certain characteristics. 
> Specifically, as a proof-of-concept, we assessed whether VoiceX can be utilized to build voices that exhibit distinct personality traits. 
> As personality is a quite complex concept, we argue that it therefore serves as an appropriate characteristic to explore the capabilities of the system.
>
> The contributions of this work are as follows:
> - We present a novel human-in-the-loop paradigm for customizing TTS voices.
> - We publicly provide a web application that can be used to create new TTS voices.
> - We present a study examining the voice customization capabilities of the system.
> - We provide an open-source Python API for easy usage of the created voices in all sorts of applications.
