## Abstract: 摘要

> Recent advancements in audio generation have been significantly propelled by the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). 
> The existing research on audio LLM has primarily focused on enhancing the architecture and scale of audio language models, as well as leveraging larger datasets, and generally, acoustic codecs, such as EnCodec, are used for audio tokenization. 
> However, these codecs were originally designed for audio compression, which may lead to suboptimal performance in the context of audio LLM. 
> Our research aims to address the shortcomings of current audio LLM codecs, particularly their challenges in maintaining semantic integrity in generated audio. 
> For instance, existing methods like VALL-E, which condition acoustic token generation on text transcriptions, often suffer from content inaccuracies and elevated word error rates (WER) due to semantic misinterpretations of acoustic tokens, resulting in word skipping and errors. 
> To overcome these issues, we propose a straightforward yet effective approach called X-Codec. 
> X-Codec incorporates semantic features from a pre-trained semantic encoder before the Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) stage and introduces a semantic reconstruction loss after RVQ. 
> By enhancing the semantic ability of the codec, X-Codec significantly reduces WER in speech synthesis tasks and extends these benefits to non-speech applications, including music and sound generation. 
> Our experiments in text-to-speech, music continuation, and text-to-sound tasks demonstrate that integrating semantic information substantially improves the overall performance of language models in audio generation. 
> Our code and demo are available.

## 1.Introduction: 引言

> In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT \cite{brown2020language} have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modeling complex, high-dimensional data across various domains, including text and image generation \cite{zhao2023survey,liu2024visual}. 
> Inspired by these successes, there has been significant interest \cite{agostinelli2023musiclm,borsos2023audiolm,wang2023neural,yang2023uniaudio} in exploring the application of LLMs to audio generation.
>
> Audio codecs \cite{zeghidour2021soundstream} have emerged as a critical technique for audio LLMs, bridging the gap between continuous audio waveforms and token-based language models. 
> By discretizing high-rate audio signals into a finite set of tokens, these codecs enable the application of LLM architectures to audio data, leveraging the successes of textual LLMs. 
>
> However, prior research on audio codecs has primarily focused on achieving lower compression rates and higher reconstruction quality \cite{kumar2024high,defossez2022high,yang2023hifi}. 
> Meanwhile, many efforts in audio generation have concentrated on enhancing model architecture, scaling, or leveraging larger datasets. 
> For instance, AudioLM \cite{borsos2023audiolm} adopts a two-stage pipeline that models the acoustic token in an autoregressive way conditioned on the semantic token. 
> VALL-E \cite{wang2023neural}, the first TTS framework to leverage large, diverse, and multi-speaker speech data, demonstrates strong in-context learning capabilities similar to GPT-3, treating TTS as a language modeling task on audio codecs. 
> MusicGen \cite{copet2024simple} generates music using a single-stage transformer LM alongside efficient token interleaving patterns. 
> Similarly, UniAudio \cite{yang2023uniaudio} scaled up to 165K hours of audio and 1B parameters, utilizing LLM techniques to generate tokens for various types of audio, including speech, sounds, music, and singing, given different input conditions.
>
> While these works have shown success in developing audio language models, they all rely on the acoustic codecs such as Encodec \cite{defossez2022high} or Soundstream \cite{zeghidour2021soundstream} for audio tokenization and de-tokenization. 
> However, these acoustic codecs were originally designed for audio compression rather than for audio language models. 
> This misalignment means the design may not be optimal for audio language modeling.
>
> To design a better audio codec for Audio LLMs, we drew inspiration from the initial purpose of LLMs such as GPT, which were designed to process text. 
> These models focus on understanding and generating natural language, which is inherently rich in semantics. 
> Motivated by this, we assume that a better audio tokenizer should encapsulate rich semantic information to facilitate an easy understanding of audio content, thus reducing the language model's burden in interpreting tokens. 
> However, most audio codecs focus on acoustic reconstruction which ignores the semantic information. 
> As a result, LLM essentially tries to predict the local fluctuations of the audio signal, which is difficult, and methods like VALL-E, which condition acoustic token generation on text transcriptions, frequently result in content inaccuracies causing elevated word error rates (WER), stemming from the semantic misinterpretations of acoustic tokens, leading to word skipping and errors.
>
> To address this issue, approaches like SpeechTokenizer \cite{zhang2023speechtokenizer} have attempted to disentangle speech into separate tokens for content and timbre and perform distillation-based semantic and acoustic integration. 
> However, this method may not integrate smoothly with all audio LLMs, especially those requiring uniform token treatment across different layers, such as utilizing flattened codec tokens \cite{yang2023uniaudio,copet2024simple}. 
>
> In this paper, We propose a straightforward yet effective method termed `X-codec`, which integrates both semantic and acoustic features into a unified tokenization framework. 
> The X-Codec architecture employs a distinctive `X-shaped` structure, characterized by two inputs and two outputs, unifying semantic and acoustic information within a single Residual Vector Quantizer (RVQ) structure. 
> This design enables simultaneous embedding learning of semantic richness and acoustic fidelity for every token, resulting in better performance for audio LLM. 
>
> We have conducted comprehensive evaluations of X-Codec across various applications, including text-to-speech, music continuation, and text-to-sound synthesis. 
> The results consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. 
> Furthermore, our comparative evaluation on VALL-E based TTS demonstrates that X-Codec outperforms existing disentanglement techniques, thereby highlighting its efficacy and versatility in advancing audio LLM technologies.
