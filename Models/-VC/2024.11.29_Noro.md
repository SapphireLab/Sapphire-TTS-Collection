## Abstract

One-shot voice conversion (VC) aims to alter the timbre of speech from a source speaker to match that of a target speaker using just a single reference speech from the target, while preserving the semantic content of the original source speech.
Despite advancements in one-shot VC, its effectiveness decreases in real-world scenarios where reference speeches, often sourced from the internet, contain various disturbances like background noise.
To address this issue, we introduce Noro, a Noise Robust One-shot VC system.
Noro features innovative components tailored for VC using noisy reference speeches, including a dual-branch reference encoding module and a noise-agnostic contrastive speaker loss.
Experimental results demonstrate that Noro outperforms our baseline system in both clean and noisy scenarios, highlighting its efficacy for real-world applications. 
Additionally, we investigate the hidden speaker representation capabilities of our baseline system by repurposing its reference encoder as a speaker encoder.
The results shows that it is competitive with several advanced self-supervised learning models for speaker representation under the SUPERB settings, highlighting the potential for advancing speaker representation learning through one-shot VC task.

## 1·Introduction

\IEEEPARstart{O}{ne-shot} voice conversion (VC) changes the timbre of speech from a source speaker to that of a target speaker using just one reference speech sample from the target, while maintaining the original speech's semantic content.

This task has been extensively researched in the deep learning era, employing various methods and producing promising results[^Popov2022Diffusion-Based], [^Li2024Sef-Vc], [^Zhang2024Amphion], [^He2024Emilia], [^Liu2024SpMis], [^Huang2024Debatts].

However, the strong performance of these one-shot VC methods is mainly demonstrated in controlled academic settings, where high-quality data is used for both training and evaluation.

As noted in[^Huang2021How], [^Huang2022Toward], [^Xie2023Noisy-to-Noisy], [^Xue2021Learning], their effectiveness significantly decreases in more challenging real-world scenarios, where reference speeches often collected from the internet are characterized by various interferences, such as background noise, which leads to a drop in the quality and similarity of the converted speech. 

Few previous works tried to address this challenge to achieve noise-robust VC.

Some researchers[^Valentini-Botinhao2016Investigating], [^Chan2021Speech] attempt to integrate a pre-trained or jointly trained speech enhancement (SE) module into standard VC systems to improve robustness.

However, these methods are not end-to-end and inevitably increase computational costs during inference.

Other researchers[^Huang2022Toward], [^Du2022Noise-Robust], [^Xue2021Learning] suggest strategies during training phase, such as direct data augmentation[^Huang2022Toward], to mitigate the impact of noise.

Despite these efforts, there is still room for improvement, especially in extremely noisy conditions where the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is below 5 dB[^Du2022Noise-Robust].

To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Noise-Robust One-shot VC system named Noro.

Noro is built on a one-shot VC baseline system based on diffusion[^Ho2020Denoising], which generates speech from pitch and semantic representations obtained through a source encoder and speaker timbre representations via a reference encoder.
*To achieve noise-robustness of the system, we focus on learning speaker timbre representations that are agnostic to noise.*

We hypothesize that maintaining noise-agnostic input representations for the acoustic model will prevent its performance from deteriorating due to noise interference.

Therefore, we propose the following designs:
First, we introduce a novel dual-branch reference encoding module.

This module consists of a dual-branch transformer encoder structure with shared weights: one branch encodes clean reference speech, while the other encodes its noisy counterpart generated through data augmentation.

Next, we devise a noise-agnostic contrastive speaker loss to maximize the similarity between samples (whether clean or noisy) from the same speaker while minimizing it for those from different speakers.

This loss ensures that the dual-branch reference encoding module learns to represent speaker timbre independent of the acoustic environment of the reference speeches.

Experimental results demonstrate that Noro significantly improves the robustness of our baseline system in both clean and noisy environments, making it an ideal choice for real-world applications that encounter noisy reference speeches.

Additionally, inspired by[^Cho2020Learning], [^Cho2021Improving], we further investigate the speaker representation capabilities of our baseline system.

The motivation stems from the fact that the reference encoder within the VC systems, trained to encode the vocal timbre of various speakers, including unseen ones, for one-shot VC, inherently functions as a speaker encoder.

This encoder develops its capability to represent speakers in a self-supervised learning (SSL) manner without needing explicit speaker labels.

Thus, we argue that the reference encoder might possess hidden abilities to function effectively as an SSL speaker encoder.

To validate this hypothesis, we employ a pre-trained reference encoder from our baseline one-shot VC system as a speaker encoder, denoted as VC-SPK2VEC, and assess its speaker representation ability through a speaker verification task under the SUPERB[^Yang2021Superb] setting.

We compare its performance against several state-of-the-art (SOTA) SSL models, including Wav2vec[^Schneider2019Wav2vec], Wav2vec 2.0[^Baevski2020Wav2vec], HuBERT[^Hsu2021Hubert], and WavLM[^Chen2021WavLM].

Surprisingly, VC-SPK2VEC achieves a competitive Equal Error Rate (EER) of 5.32\%, comparable to these SOTA SSL models.

This result confirms the effectiveness of VC-SPK2VEC as an SSL speaker encoder and underscores the potential for leveraging one-shot VC tasks in advancing speaker representation learning.

Our contributions in this work can be summarized as follows.

-  We proposed Noro, a Noise-Robust One-shot VC system.

It achieves noise robustness through innovative designs, including a dual-branch reference encoding module, a noise-agnostic contrastive speaker loss.

Experimental results demonstrate that Noro significantly outperforms state-of-the-art one-shot VC systems in noisy scenarios, establishing it as the preferred choice for real-world applications requiring reliable, high-quality VC in diverse and challenging acoustic environments.

-  We investigated the hidden speaker representation capabilities of the proposed one-shot VC system by repurposing its reference encoder as a speaker encoder (VC-SPK2VEC).

VC-SPK2VEC exhibits comparable performance with several SOTA SSL models in speaker representation under the SUPERB setting, highlighting the overlooked potential for speaker representation learning via the one-shot VC task.
