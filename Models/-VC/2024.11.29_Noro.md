## Abstract

One-shot voice conversion (VC) aims to alter the timbre of speech from a source speaker to match that of a target speaker using just a single reference speech from the target, while preserving the semantic content of the original source speech.
Despite advancements in one-shot VC, its effectiveness decreases in real-world scenarios where reference speeches, often sourced from the internet, contain various disturbances like background noise.
To address this issue, we introduce Noro, a Noise Robust One-shot VC system.
Noro features innovative components tailored for VC using noisy reference speeches, including a dual-branch reference encoding module and a noise-agnostic contrastive speaker loss.
Experimental results demonstrate that Noro outperforms our baseline system in both clean and noisy scenarios, highlighting its efficacy for real-world applications. 
Additionally, we investigate the hidden speaker representation capabilities of our baseline system by repurposing its reference encoder as a speaker encoder.
The results shows that it is competitive with several advanced self-supervised learning models for speaker representation under the SUPERB settings, highlighting the potential for advancing speaker representation learning through one-shot VC task.
