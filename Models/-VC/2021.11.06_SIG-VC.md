## 1·Introduction

\label{sec:intro}

Voice Conversion (VC) is a task that aims at converting the timbres from source speakers to target speakers while keeping the content of speech unchanged.

For traditional VC tasks, many systems manage to synthesize speech with good quality, in which the source and target speakers are seen in the training data.

On the other hand, it remains a challenge for voice conversion under the condition that the data of source or target speakers is scarce and unseen in the training stage.

Zero-shot voice conversion is one of the challenges, and most VC systems are not robust enough for it.

Previously, there are research works proposed for addressing the unseen voice conversion problem.

In the perspective of frameworks, generative adversarial networks (GAN) and auto-encoder are the most frequently used ones.

StarGAN is a GAN-based voice conversion framework proposed in [^Choi2018Stargan], then [^Wang2020One-Shot], [^Zhang2020Gazev] extended this framework to achieve one-shot VC. [^Rebryk2020ConVoice], [^Qian2019Autovc], [^Chou2019One-Shot], [^Chen2021Again-Vc], [^Yuan2021Improving], [^Mohammadi2019One-Shot], [^Lu2019One-Shot], [^Deng2020One-Shot], [^Wu2020Vqvc+] are all auto-encoder-based (AE-based) systems, with different variants.

In particular, [^Yuan2021Improving] proposes an AE-based system to extract the speaker embedding and content embedding using mutual information.

Alternatively, [^Wu2020Vqvc+] adopts the U-net architecture in AE-based VC, along with vector quantization [^Gray1984Vector] to disentangle the speaker information and the content information.

In addition, [^Chou2019One-Shot], [^Chen2021Again-Vc] disentangle the speaker and content information by instance normalization, which is also used in [^Wu2020Vqvc+], [^Zhang2020Gazev]. [^Ebbers2021Contrastive] try to separate speaker and content information using variational auto-encoder (VAE).

To better achieve the disentanglement capability, several works use pre-trained models as the speaker or content encoder.

For instance, with the support from the automatic speech recognition system, [^Mohammadi2019One-Shot], [^Lu2019One-Shot] use the phonetic posteriorgrams as the content representation in VC.

On the contrary, [^Qian2019Autovc], [^Deng2020One-Shot] uses speaker verification (SV) systems as their speaker encoders to obtain discriminative representations.

Many aforementioned systems disentangle speaker and content information by finding plausible latent representations.

Nevertheless, most of them apply the reconstruction loss to minimize the difference between the predicted acoustic feature and the target one during training without direct supervision on latent representations.

In this case, it is difficult for latent representations to be robust enough for disentangled content or speaker information.

We believe this might be the reason why the trade-off question mentioned in [^Chen2021Again-Vc] exists, which refers to the issue that the aforementioned systems are not very robust in synthesizing speech with both good similarity and naturalness under the zero-shot scenario. 

In this paper, we propose SIG-VC, a **S**peaker **I**nformation **G**uided **V**oice **C**onversion system.

In our proposed system, we introduce a novel approach to supervise the intermediate representation.

This supervision aims to remove the speaker information from the linguistic information.

Specifically, we employ a pre-trained speaker verification system for speaker representation extraction.

Regarding the linguistic content, a pre-trained acoustic model is applied to extract the linguistic feature.

Experiments in [^Yang2021Building] show that there is speaker information persisting in the linguistic information extracted by the acoustic recognition model.  We manage to get purified content information by eliminating the residual speaker information in the speech.

More detailedly, by sharing parameters for some modules in the system, we force the intermediate representation to be in the vector space of our selected acoustic feature.

Then we erase the speaker information from the intermediate representation with the supervision of the speaker encoder.

Finally, by conditioning on the speaker information of the target speaker, we manage to generate the target speech.

Our proposed system also applies the feedback loss control on the output, which is proposed by [^Cai2020From] and applied on VC in [^Du2021Optimizing].

By adding this loss, the generated results of our proposed system demonstrate high spoofing capability to speaker verification systems. 

To our knowledge, we are the first to propose an approach to supervise the intermediate representation in order to remove speaker information and get pure content representation.

By applying this intermediate representation supervision mechanism, our system outperforms the previous state-of-the-art system, AGAIN-VC [^Chen2021Again-Vc] in zero-shot voice conversion.

This paper is organized as follows: Section [sec:method](#sec:method) introduces our proposed framework for zero-shot voice conversion.

Section [implementation](#implementation) exhibits the implementation details of our proposed system.

The experimental details, along with the results, are presented in Section [sec:exp](#sec:exp).

Finally, we conclude our work in Section [sec:con](#sec:con).  

## 2·Proposed Methods

\label{sec:method}

### System overview

\label{ssec:overview}

Figure [fig:architecture](#fig:architecture) shows the structure of our proposed system.

A pre-trained content encoder is applied to extract linguistic information, which contains residual speaker information.

Also, a pre-trained speaker encoder is used to extract speaker embedding from the same utterance.

The output of the two encoders is concatenated and fed into the PreNet1 module.

The PreNet1 is designed for projecting the input into latent representations such that the following speaker information manipulator can remove the speaker information.

Similarly, PreNet2 is designed for projecting the input into another latent space so that the same speaker information manipulator can add the target speaker's information to the intermediate content representation.

Here, PreNet1 and SI manipulator together is called SI remover, while PreNet2 and SI manipulator together is called SI adder.

The Mel embedding layer is used to project the Mel-spectrogram feature  without speaker information back into linguistic information.

Finally, a PostNet is designed to finetune the predicted Mel-spectrogram.

### Content encoder

\label{ssec:content encoder}

The content encoder in our proposed system is part of a speech recognition model trained by Kaldi [^Povey2011Kaldi].

The speech recognition model is constructed by time-delayed neural networks (TDNN), where the linear layer before the output layer is designed to be a low-dimensional layer, which is also known as the bottleneck layer [^Gr{\'e}zl2007Probabilistic].

The output of this layer is a good representation of linguistic information.

Thus, we take the part before the output layer as our content encoder.

### Speaker encoder

\label{ssec:speaker encoder}

In general, we want our speaker encoder to extract speaker information that captures the voice characteristics.

Speaker representations from different speakers are expected to be distinguishable in the corresponding vector space.

To that end, speaker verification (SV) systems are suitable choices.

SV systems can be used to extract speaker embeddings to represent voices from different speakers.

Since the encoder is trained and inferred in a text-independent manner, most of the information left in the embedding is about the speaker's timbre.

Therefore, we believe the speaker embedding extracted by text-independent SV system can well represent timbres.

In this case, we incorporate the ECAPA-TDNN [^Desplanques2020Ecapa-TDNN] as our speaker encoder in our proposed model.

### PreNet and speaker information manipulator

\label{ssec:prenet and SI}

The PreNet is a stack of two linear layers, with each followed by a ReLU activation layer and a dropout layer.

The structure of the speaker information manipulator is shown in part (b) and (c) of Figure [fig:architecture](#fig:architecture).

This structure is a modified version of the FastSpeech [^Ren2019FastSpeech] model on VC task.

The input is positionally encoded and fed into the transformer encoder or decoder with a multi-head attention mechanism.

The Mel Linear layer is a linear layer that transforms the output of the decoder into the same Mel space as the input Mel-spectrogram.

PreNet1, along with the speaker information manipulator, achieves the function of removing speaker information.

Alternatively, PreNet2 along with the speaker information manipulator, achieves the function of adding speaker information.

Since the parameters are shared for the two speaker information manipulators, PreNet1 essentially indicates the remove of speaker information while PreNet2 indicates the addition of speaker information.

### Supervision on intermediate representation

\label{ssec:mid loss}

According to the experiment results in [^Yang2021Building], although the pre-trained content encoder can provide precise linguistic information, it still contains speaker information.

Thus we apply the speaker information remover as shown in Figure [fig:architecture](#fig:architecture) to remove the speaker information, and ideally, we can obtain purified content information. 

Since it is hard to directly evaluate whether the speaker information is removed or not, we propose a method to force the intermediate representation to be in the same vector space as the input acoustic feature, which is plausible for extracting speaker embedding.

Accordingly, we can eliminate the speaker information by minimizing the values of all dimensions of the intermediate representation's speaker embedding.

In our model, the intermediate representation refers to the output of speaker information remover.

Since the two speaker information manipulators in Figure [fig:architecture](#fig:architecture) share the same set of parameters, and the output of the speaker information manipulator in SI adder is supervised to be in the Mel-spectrogram space, the output of the SI manipulator in SI remover is therefore forced to be in Mel-spectrogram space as well.

As our speaker encoder takes Mel-spectrograms as input and predicts corresponding speaker embeddings, we expect the speaker encoder's prediction on intermediate representation to provide speaker information.

We consider the value on each dimension of the speaker embedding as an indicator for a certain characteristic of the corresponding speaker's timbre.

Then minimizing the values on all dimensions of speaker embedding is one plausible way to remove speaker information.

Denoting $\Vec{e}$ as the speaker embedding extracted from intermediate representation, we define a training loss called intermediate speaker loss as follows:

$$

L_{mid\_spk}=\Vert \Vec{e}-\boldsymbol{0} \Vert_1 \label{mid_spk}

$$

### Supervision on prediceted Mel-spectrogram

During the training process, our proposed model learns to remove the speaker information from the given Mel-spectrogram and then add the same speaker information to reconstruct the original Mel-spectrogram.

Let $\hat X$ denote the output of SI adder, and $X$ denote the given Mel-spectrogram.

Reconstruction loss is defined as follows to make the predicted Mel-spectrogram close to the target Mel-spectrogram.

$$

L_{recon}=\Vert X-\hat{X} \Vert_1 \label{recon}

$$

We design the PostNet to finetune the predicted Mel-spectrogram.

The reconstruction loss is also applied to the output of PostNet.

Denoted the output of PostNet as $\hat{X}_{postnet}$, the Postnet reconstruction loss is

$$

L_{recon\_postnet}=\Vert X-\hat X_{postnet} \Vert_1 \label{recon_postnet}

$$

To better control the distribution of the predicted Mel-spectrogram, we also apply standard deviation loss.

We denote the target Mel-spectrogram as $X$ with shape $T \times d$, where d represents the dimensionality of the Mel-spectrogram and T represents the number of frames.

Then let $X_{std}$ denote a $d \times 1$ standard deviation vector where 

$$

X_{std}^{i}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{t=0}^{T}(X_{i,t}-\bar{X_i})^2}{T}},0<i \le d \label{std}

$$

Let $\hat X_{std}$ denote the standard deviation vector for the output of PostNet.

Then the standard deviation loss is defined as 

$$

L_{std}=\Vert X_{std}-\hat X_{std} \Vert_1 \label{std_loss}

$$

We also apply the loss proposed by [^Cai2020From] to the output of PostNet as the speaker reconstruction loss.

Denoted the speaker embedding extracted from target Mel-spectrogram as $\boldsymbol{s}$ and the one extracted from the predicted Mel-spectrogram as $\boldsymbol{\hat{s}}$, then the speaker reconstruction loss is 

$$
L_{spk}=1-cos<\boldsymbol{s}, \boldsymbol{\hat{s}}> \label{spk_loss}

$$

where $cos<\boldsymbol{s},\boldsymbol{\hat{s}}>$ means the cosine similarity between the vector $\boldsymbol{s}$ and $\boldsymbol{\hat{s}}$.

### Training loss

In the training stage, we use the following loss,

$$

L = L_{mid\_spk}+L_{recon}+L_{recon\_postnet}+L_{std}+\lambda \cdot L_{spk}

$$

where $\lambda$ is the coefficient for speaker loss.
