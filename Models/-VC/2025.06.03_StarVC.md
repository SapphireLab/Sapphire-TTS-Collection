## 摘要

**Voice Conversion (VC)** modifies speech to match a target speaker while preserving linguistic content.
Traditional methods usually extract speaker information directly from speech while neglecting the explicit utilization of linguistic content.
Since VC fundamentally involves disentangling speaker identity from linguistic content, leveraging structured semantic features could enhance conversion performance.
However, previous attempts to incorporate semantic features into VC have shown limited effectiveness, motivating the integration of explicit text modeling.
We propose ***StarVC***, a unified autoregressive VC framework that first predicts text tokens before synthesizing acoustic features.
The experiments demonstrate that ***StarVC*** outperforms conventional VC methods in preserving both linguistic content (i.e., WER and CER) and speaker characteristics (i.e., SECS and MOS).
