## Abstract: 摘要

Neural speech codec has recently gained widespread attention in generative speech modeling domains, like voice conversion, text-to-speech synthesis, etc.
However, ensuring high-fidelity audio reconstruction of speech codecs under low bitrate remains an open and challenging issue.
In this paper, we propose ***PromptCodec***, a novel end-to-end neural speech codec using feature-aware prompt encoders based on disentangled representation learning.
By incorporating prompt encoders to capture representations of additional input prompts, ***PromptCodec*** can distribute the speech information requiring processing and enhance its representation capabilities.
Moreover, a simple yet effective adaptive feature weighted fusion approach is introduced to integrate features of different encoders.
Meanwhile, we propose a novel disentangled representation learning strategy based on structure similarity index measure to optimize ***PromptCodec***'s encoders to ensure their efficiency, thereby further improving the performance of ***PromptCodec***.
Experiments on LibriTTS demonstrate that our proposed ***PromptCodec*** consistently outperforms state-of-the-art neural speech codec models under all different bitrate conditions while achieving superior performance with low bitrates.
