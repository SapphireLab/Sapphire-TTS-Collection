## Abstract

Neural audio codecs are foundational to speech language models.
It is expected to have a low frame rate and decoupled semantic and acoustic information.
A lower frame rate codec can reduce the computational cost of speech language models by shortening the sequence length.
Recent studies have developed 12.5Hz low-frame-rate audio codecs, but even lower frame rate codecs remain underexplored.
We find that a major challenge for very low frame rate tokens is missing semantic information.
This paper introduces **FlexiCodec** to address this limitation.
FlexiCodec improves semantic preservation with a **dynamic frame rate** approach and introduces a novel architecture featuring an **ASR feature-assisted dual stream** encoding and Transformer bottlenecks.
With dynamic frame rates, it uses less frames at information-sparse regions through adaptively merging semantically similar frames.
A dynamic frame rate also allows FlexiCodec to support inference-time **controllable frame rates** between 3Hz and 12.5Hz.
Experiments on **6.25Hz, 8.3Hz and 12.5Hz** average frame rates confirm that FlexiCodec excels over baseline systems in semantic information preservation and delivers a high audio reconstruction quality.
We also validate the effectiveness of FlexiCodec in language model-based TTS.
