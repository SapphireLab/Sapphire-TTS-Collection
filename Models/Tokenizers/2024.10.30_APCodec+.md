## Abstract: 摘要

This paper proposes a novel neural audio codec, named ***APCodec+***, which is an improved version of APCodec.
The ***APCodec+*** takes the audio amplitude and phase spectra as the coding object, and employs an adversarial training strategy.
Innovatively, we propose a two-stage joint-individual training paradigm for ***APCodec+***.
In the joint training stage, the encoder, quantizer, decoder and discriminator are jointly trained with complete spectral loss, quantization loss, and adversarial loss.
In the individual training stage, the encoder and quantizer fix their parameters and provide high-quality training data for the decoder and discriminator.
The decoder and discriminator are individually trained from scratch without the quantization loss.
The purpose of introducing individual training is to reduce the learning difficulty of the decoder, thereby further improving the fidelity of the decoded audio.
Experimental results confirm that our proposed ***APCodec+*** at low bitrates achieves comparable performance with baseline codecs at higher bitrates, thanks to the proposed staged training paradigm.
