## Abstract: 摘要

Recent advances in speech spoofing necessitate stronger verification mechanisms in neural speech codecs to ensure authenticity.
Current methods embed numerical watermarks before compression and extract them from reconstructed speech for verification, but face limitations such as separate training processes for the watermark and codec, and insufficient cross-modal information integration, leading to reduced watermark imperceptibility, extraction accuracy, and capacity.
To address these issues, we propose ***WMCodec***, the first neural speech codec to jointly train compression-reconstruction and watermark embedding-extraction in an end-to-end manner, optimizing both imperceptibility and extractability of the watermark.
Furthermore, We design an iterative Attention Imprint Unit (AIU) for deeper feature integration of watermark and speech, reducing the impact of quantization noise on the watermark.
Experimental results show ***WMCodec*** outperforms AudioSeal with Encodec in most quality metrics for watermark imperceptibility and consistently exceeds both AudioSeal with Encodec and reinforced TraceableSpeech in extraction accuracy of watermark.
At bandwidth of 6 kbps with a watermark capacity of 16 bps, ***WMCodec*** maintains over 99% extraction accuracy under common attacks, demonstrating strong robustness.
