## Abstract: 摘要

<table><tr><td width="50%">

Although recent works on neural vocoder have improved the quality of synthesized audio, there still exists a gap between generated and ground-truth audio in frequency space.
This difference leads to spectral artifacts such as hissing noise or reverberation, and thus degrades the sample quality.
In this paper, we propose Fre-GAN which achieves frequency-consistent audio synthesis with highly improved generation quality.
Specifically, we first present resolution-connected generator and resolution-wise discriminators, which help learn various scales of spectral distributions over multiple frequency bands.
Additionally, to reproduce high-frequency components accurately, we leverage discrete wavelet transform in the discriminators.
From our experiments, Fre-GAN achieves high-fidelity waveform generation with a gap of only 0.03 MOS compared to ground-truth audio while outperforming standard models in quality.
