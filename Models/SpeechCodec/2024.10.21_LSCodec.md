## Abstract: 摘要

Although discrete speech tokens have exhibited strong potential for language model-based speech generation, their high bitrates and redundant timbre information restrict the development of such models.
In this work, we propose ***LSCodec***, a discrete speech codec that has both low bitrate and speaker decoupling ability.
***LSCodec*** adopts a three-stage unsupervised training framework with a speaker perturbation technique.
A continuous information bottleneck is first established, followed by vector quantization that produces a discrete speaker-decoupled space.
A discrete token vocoder finally refines acoustic details from ***LSCodec***.
By reconstruction experiments, ***LSCodec*** demonstrates superior intelligibility and audio quality with only a single codebook and smaller vocabulary size than baselines.
The 25Hz version of ***LSCodec*** also achieves the lowest bitrate (0.25kbps) of codecs so far with decent quality.
Voice conversion evaluations prove the satisfactory speaker disentanglement of ***LSCodec***, and ablation study further verifies the effectiveness of the proposed training framework.
