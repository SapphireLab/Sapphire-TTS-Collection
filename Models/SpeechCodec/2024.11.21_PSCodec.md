## Abstract: 摘要

Neural speech codecs have recently emerged as a focal point in the fields of speech compression and generation.
Despite this progress, achieving high-quality speech reconstruction under low-bitrate scenarios remains a significant challenge.
In this paper, we propose ***PSCodec***, a series of neural speech codecs based on prompt encoders, comprising ***PSCodec-Base***, ***PSCodec-DRL-ICT***, and ***PSCodec-CasAN***, which are capable of delivering high-performance speech reconstruction with low bandwidths.
Specifically, we first introduce ***PSCodec-Base***, which leverages a pretrained speaker verification model-based prompt encoder (VPP-Enc) and a learnable Mel-spectrogram-based prompt encoder (MelP-Enc) to effectively disentangle and integrate voiceprint and Mel-related features in utterances.
To further enhance feature utilization efficiency, we propose ***PSCodec-DRL-ICT***, incorporating a structural similarity (SSIM) based disentangled representation loss (DRL) and an incremental continuous training (ICT) strategy.
While ***PSCodec-DRL-ICT*** demonstrates impressive performance, its reliance on extensive hyperparameter tuning and multi-stage training makes it somewhat labor-intensive.
To circumvent these limitations, we propose ***PSCodec-CasAN***, utilizing an advanced cascaded attention network (CasAN) to enhance representational capacity of the entire system.
Extensive experiments show that our proposed ***PSCodec-Base***, ***PSCodec-DRL-ICT***, and ***PSCodec-CasAN*** all significantly outperform several state-of-the-art neural codecs, exhibiting substantial improvements in both speech reconstruction quality and speaker similarity under low-bitrate conditions.
