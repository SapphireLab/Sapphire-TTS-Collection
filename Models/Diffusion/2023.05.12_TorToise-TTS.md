## Abstract: 摘要

In recent years, the field of image generation has been revolutionized by the application of autoregressive transformers and DDPMs.
These approaches model the process of image generation as a step-wise probabilistic processes and leverage large amounts of compute and data to learn the image distribution.
This methodology of improving performance need not be confined to images.
This paper describes a way to apply advances in the image generative domain to speech synthesis.
The result is TorToise -- an expressive, multi-voice text-to-speech system.
All model code and trained weights have been open-sourced at [this https URL](https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts).
