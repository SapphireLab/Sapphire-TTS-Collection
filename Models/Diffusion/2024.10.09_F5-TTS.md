## Abstract: 摘要

This paper introduces ***F5-TTS***, a fully non-autoregressive text-to-speech system based on flow matching with Diffusion Transformer (DiT).
Without requiring complex designs such as duration model, text encoder, and phoneme alignment, the text input is simply padded with filler tokens to the same length as input speech, and then the denoising is performed for speech generation, which was originally proved feasible by E2 TTS.
However, the original design of E2 TTS makes it hard to follow due to its slow convergence and low robustness.
To address these issues, we first model the input with ConvNeXt to refine the text representation, making it easy to align with the speech.
We further propose an inference-time Sway Sampling strategy, which significantly improves our model's performance and efficiency.
This sampling strategy for flow step can be easily applied to existing flow matching based models without retraining.
Our design allows faster training and achieves an inference RTF of 0.15, which is greatly improved compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based TTS models.
Trained on a public 100K hours multilingual dataset, our ***Fairytaler Fakes Fluent and Faithful speech with Flow matching (F5-TTS)*** exhibits highly natural and expressive zero-shot ability, seamless code-switching capability, and speed control efficiency.
Demo samples can be found at [this https URL](https://swivid.github.io/F5-TTS).
We release all code and checkpoints to promote community development ([Github](https://github.com/SWivid/F5-TTS)).
