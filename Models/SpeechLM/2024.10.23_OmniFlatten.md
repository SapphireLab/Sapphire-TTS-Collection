## Abstract: 摘要

Full-duplex spoken dialogue systems significantly advance over traditional turn-based dialogue systems, as they allow simultaneous bidirectional communication, closely mirroring human-human interactions.
However, achieving low latency and natural interactions in full-duplex dialogue systems remains a significant challenge, especially considering human conversation dynamics such as interruptions, backchannels, and overlapping speech.
In this paper, we introduce a novel End-to-End GPT-based model ***OmniFlatten*** for full-duplex conversation, capable of effectively modeling the complex behaviors inherent to natural conversations with low latency.
To achieve full-duplex communication capabilities, we propose a multi-stage post-training scheme that progressively adapts a text-based large language model (LLM) backbone into a speech-text dialogue LLM, capable of generating text and speech in real time, without modifying the architecture of the backbone LLM.
The training process comprises three stages: modality alignment, half-duplex dialogue learning, and full-duplex dialogue learning.
Throughout all training stages, we standardize the data using a flattening operation, which allows us to unify the training methods and the model architecture across different modalities and tasks.
Our approach offers a straightforward modeling technique and a promising research direction for developing efficient and natural end-to-end full-duplex spoken dialogue systems.
Audio samples of dialogues generated by ***OmniFlatten*** can be found at [this web site](https://omniflatten.github.io/).
