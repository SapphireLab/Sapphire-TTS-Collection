## Abstract: 摘要

In the domain of audio processing, Transfer Learning has facilitated the rise of Self-Supervised Learning and Zero-Shot Learning techniques.
These approaches have led to the development of versatile models capable of tackling a wide array of tasks, while delivering state-of-the-art performance.
However, current models inherently lack the capacity to produce the requisite language for open-ended tasks, such as Audio Captioning or Audio Question & Answering.
We introduce ***Pengi***, a novel Audio Language Model that leverages Transfer Learning by framing all audio tasks as text-generation tasks.
It takes as input, an audio recording, and text, and generates free-form text as output.
The input audio is represented as a sequence of continuous embeddings by an audio encoder.
A text encoder does the same for the corresponding text input.
Both sequences are combined as a prefix to prompt a pre-trained frozen language model.
The unified architecture of ***Pengi*** enables open-ended tasks and close-ended tasks without any additional fine-tuning or task-specific extensions.
When evaluated on 22 downstream tasks, our approach yields state-of-the-art performance in several of them.
Our results show that connecting language models with audio models is a major step towards general-purpose audio understanding.
