## Abstract: 摘要

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal speech-text models have laid the groundwork for seamless voice interactions, enabling real-time, natural, and human-like conversations.
Previous models for voice interactions are categorized as native and aligned.
Native models integrate speech and text processing in one framework but struggle with issues like differing sequence lengths and insufficient pre-training.
Aligned models maintain text LLM capabilities but are often limited by small datasets and a narrow focus on speech tasks.
In this work, we introduce ***MinMo***, a Multimodal Large Language Model with approximately 8B parameters for seamless voice interaction.
We address the main limitations of prior aligned multimodal models.
We train ***MinMo*** through multiple stages of speech-to-text alignment, text-to-speech alignment, speech-to-speech alignment, and duplex interaction alignment, on 1.4 million hours of diverse speech data and a broad range of speech tasks.
After the multi-stage training, ***MinMo*** achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks for voice comprehension and generation while maintaining the capabilities of text LLMs, and also facilitates full-duplex conversation, that is, simultaneous two-way communication between the user and the system.
Moreover, we propose a novel and simple voice decoder that outperforms prior models in voice generation.
The enhanced instruction-following capabilities of ***MinMo*** supports controlling speech generation based on user instructions, with various nuances including emotions, dialects, and speaking rates, and mimicking specific voices.
For ***MinMo***, the speech-to-text latency is approximately 100ms, full-duplex latency is approximately 600ms in theory and 800ms in practice.
The ***MinMo*** project web page is [this https URL](https://funaudiollm.github.io/minmo), and the code and models will be released soon.
