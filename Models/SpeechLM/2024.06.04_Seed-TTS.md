## Abstract: 摘要

We introduce ***Seed-TTS***, a family of large-scale autoregressive text-to-speech (TTS) models capable of generating speech that is virtually indistinguishable from human speech.
***Seed-TTS*** serves as a foundation model for speech generation and excels in speech in-context learning, achieving performance in speaker similarity and naturalness that matches ground truth human speech in both objective and subjective evaluations.
With fine-tuning, we achieve even higher subjective scores across these metrics.
***Seed-TTS*** offers superior controllability over various speech attributes such as emotion and is capable of generating highly expressive and diverse speech for speakers in the wild.
Furthermore, we propose a self-distillation method for speech factorization, as well as a reinforcement learning approach to enhance model robustness, speaker similarity, and controllability.
We additionally present a non-autoregressive (NAR) variant of the ***Seed-TTS*** model, named ***Seed-TTS_DiT***, which utilizes a fully diffusion-based architecture.
Unlike previous NAR-based TTS systems, ***Seed-TTS_DiT*** does not depend on pre-estimated phoneme durations and performs speech generation through end-to-end processing.
We demonstrate that this variant achieves comparable performance to the language model-based variant and showcase its effectiveness in speech editing.
