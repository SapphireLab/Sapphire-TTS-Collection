## Abstract: 摘要

Codec-based text-to-speech (TTS) models have shown impressive quality with zero-shot voice cloning abilities.
However, they often struggle with more expressive references or complex text inputs.
We present MARS6, a robust encoder-decoder transformer for rapid, expressive TTS.
MARS6 is built on recent improvements in spoken language modelling.
Utilizing a hierarchical setup for its decoder, new speech tokens are processed at a rate of only 12 Hz, enabling efficient modelling of long-form text while retaining reconstruction quality.
We combine several recent training and inference techniques to reduce repetitive generation and improve output stability and quality.
This enables the 70M-parameter MARS6 to achieve similar performance to models many times larger.
We show this in objective and subjective evaluations, comparing TTS output quality and reference speaker cloning ability.
