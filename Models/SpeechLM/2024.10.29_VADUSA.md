## Abstract: 摘要

The auto-regressive architecture, like GPTs, is widely used in modern Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems.
However, it incurs substantial inference time, particularly due to the challenges in the next-token prediction posed by lengthy sequences of speech tokens.
In this work, we introduce ***VADUSA***, one of the first approaches to accelerate auto-regressive TTS through speculative decoding.
Our results show that ***VADUSA*** not only significantly improves inference speed but also enhances performance by incorporating draft heads to predict future speech content auto-regressively.
Furthermore, the inclusion of a tolerance mechanism during sampling accelerates inference without compromising quality.
Our approach demonstrates strong generalization across large datasets and various types of speech tokens.
