## Abstract: 摘要

<table><tr><td width="50%">

Real-time speech interaction, serving as a fundamental interface for human-machine collaboration, holds immense potential.
However, current open-source models face limitations such as high costs in voice data collection, weakness in dynamic control, and limited intelligence.
To address these challenges, this paper introduces Step-Audio, the first production-ready open-source solution.
Key contributions include:
1) a 130B-parameter unified speech-text multi-modal model that achieves unified understanding and generation, with the Step-Audio-Chat version open-sourced;
2) a generative speech data engine that establishes an affordable voice cloning framework and produces the open-sourced lightweight Step-Audio-TTS-3B model through distillation;
3) an instruction-driven fine control system enabling dynamic adjustments across dialects, emotions, singing, and RAP;
4) an enhanced cognitive architecture augmented with tool calling and role-playing abilities to manage complex tasks effectively.

Based on our new StepEval-Audio-360 evaluation benchmark, Step-Audio achieves state-of-the-art performance in human evaluations, especially in terms of instruction following.
On open-source benchmarks like LLaMA Question, shows 9.3% average performance improvement, demonstrating our commitment to advancing the development of open-source multi-modal language technologies.
