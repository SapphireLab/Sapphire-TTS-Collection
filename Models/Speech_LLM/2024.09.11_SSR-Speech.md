## Abstract: 摘要

> In this paper, we introduce SSR-Speech, a neural codec autoregressive model designed for stable, safe, and robust zero-shot text-based speech editing and text-to-speech synthesis. 
> SSR-Speech is built on a Transformer decoder and incorporates classifier-free guidance to enhance the stability of the generation process. 
> A watermark Encodec is proposed to embed frame-level watermarks into the edited regions of the speech so that which parts were edited can be detected. 
> In addition, the waveform reconstruction leverages the original unedited speech segments, providing superior recovery compared to the Encodec model. 
> Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the RealEdit speech editing task and the LibriTTS text-to-speech task, surpassing previous methods. Furthermore, SSR-Speech excels in multi-span speech editing and also demonstrates remarkable robustness to background sounds. 
> [Source code](https://github.com/WangHelin1997/SSR-Speech) and [demos](https://wanghelin1997.github.io/SSR-Speech-Demo/) are released.
