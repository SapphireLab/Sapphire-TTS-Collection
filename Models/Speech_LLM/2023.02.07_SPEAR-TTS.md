## Abstract

> We introduce ***SPEAR-TTS***, a multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) system that can be trained with minimal supervision.
> By combining two types of discrete speech representations, we cast TTS as a composition of two sequence-to-sequence tasks: from text to high-level semantic tokens (akin to "reading") and from semantic tokens to low-level acoustic tokens ("speaking").
> Decoupling these two tasks enables training of the "speaking" module using abundant audio-only data, and unlocks the highly efficient combination of pretraining and backtranslation to reduce the need for parallel data when training the "reading" component.
> To control the speaker identity, we adopt example prompting, which allows ***SPEAR-TTS*** to generalize to unseen speakers using only a short sample of 3 seconds, without any explicit speaker representation or speaker-id labels.
> Our experiments demonstrate that ***SPEAR-TTS*** achieves a character error rate that is competitive with state-of-the-art methods using only 15 minutes of parallel data, while matching ground-truth speech in terms of naturalness and acoustic quality, as measured in subjective tests.
