## Abstract

Any-to-any singing voice conversion (SVC) aims to transfer a target singer's timbre to other songs using a short voice sample.
However many diffusion model based any-to-any SVC methods, which have achieved impressive results, usually suffered from low efficiency caused by a mass of inference steps.
In this paper, we propose LCM-SVC, a latent consistency distillation (LCD) based latent  diffusion model (LDM) to  accelerate inference speed. 
We  achieved one-step or few-step inference while maintaining the high performance by distilling a pre-trained LDM based SVC model, which had the advantages of  timbre decoupling and sound quality.
Experimental results show that our proposed method can significantly reduce the inference time and largely preserve the sound quality and timbre similarity comparing with other state-of-the-art SVC models.
